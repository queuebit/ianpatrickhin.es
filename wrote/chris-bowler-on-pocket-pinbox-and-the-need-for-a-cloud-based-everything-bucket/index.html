      <h1>
        Chris Bowler on Pocket, Pinbox and the need for a cloud-based Everything Bucket
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>Chris Bowler &mdash; who you likely know as one of the co-founders of Fusion Ads &mdash; offers what I think is some of the most thoughtful commentary on the recent release of&nbsp;<a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>. He&rsquo;s clearly given it a lot of thought, and I think that he and I are basically on the same page with regard to the need for a cloud-based &ldquo;everything bucket&rdquo; / inbox.</p>

<p>Where I agree with him most is on the potential utility of Pocket, which I&rsquo;ve already adopted in lieu of&nbsp;<a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://readability.com">Readability</a>:</p>

<blockquote>What excited me about the news was not the monetizing strategy or the overall execution of the design, although I&rsquo;m not yet sold on the former and the latter was well done. Rather, I was very impressed with the focus on the save-anything-for-later concept. This is an idea that has been on my mind the past year, as there has been a gap in the services available to us.</blockquote>

<p>For my part, I&rsquo;ve found Pocket to be useful for exactly this reason: it&rsquo;s a place that I can throw anything that I find on the fly. Then, at regular intervals &mdash; as with my OmniFocus &amp; email inboxes &mdash; I can go through and decide what to do with the stuff I&rsquo;ve thrown in there.</p>

<p>Where we disagree (though, I think it was more of a miscommunication than a disagreement) is with regard to Pocket&rsquo;s target market. When it was first released, I said the folks at Pocket were &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ianpatrickhines/status/192294436984725504">clearly marketing to women &mdash; not design / internet geeks</a>.&rdquo; I think this remark was misunderstood.</p>

<p>Everything about Pocket &mdash; the feel of the design, the color choices, the fonts &mdash; exudes a &ldquo;mass-market audience&rdquo; vibe (to me). Especially when contrasted with something like Instapaper, which admittedly was built by a developer, not a designer, and feels more like a tool than a product, Pocket&rsquo;s polish indicates to me that are aiming at skipping the early-adopter market (which they assume will come along, anyway, as Chris and I have) and aiming straight for the early-mass market demographic.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t consider this to be a criticism. I think it&rsquo;s fantastic. My original tweet was meant as a compliment: I was trying to say that they &ldquo;get it&rdquo; when it comes to marketing a product for wide adoption. I think Chris may have misunderstood and thought that I meant that Pocket wasn&rsquo;t up-to-snuff for power users. It is. But it&rsquo;s also simple, accessible and appealing to a less aggressive and tech-savvy audience &mdash; to people who don&rsquo;t think about &ldquo;everything buckets&rdquo; &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what makes it great.</p>

<p>Of course, interesting as the back-and-forth about Pocket&rsquo;s target market, etc., is to discuss, it&rsquo;s decidedly tangential in Chris&rsquo;s post. I&rsquo;d really encourage you to read what he has to say about his abandoned idea for Pinbox, and why a well-made, cloud based &ldquo;everything bucket&rdquo; is a real need in today&rsquo;s content-heavy world. It&rsquo;s great stuff from a really thoughtful guy.</p>
