<article class="block">
  <p>When I was in high school I blogged a lot. I blogged about good days, and more often about bad ones. I blogged about what I liked and what I didn&rsquo;t, and often times the things I said were less than mature. But what did I care? This was 2003 &ndash; 04, and blogging was so new and exciting; very few people were giving serious thought to what the long term consequences would be. I relished in using the Internet as a sounding board on which I could vent about all of the things I was thinking but didn&rsquo;t want to share with the people around me.</p>

<p>Of course I quickly realized that this was absurd. The Internet is the single greatest tool for permanent archiving of human knowledge and writing the world has ever known, and yet I was treating it as a private journal? Was I out of my mind? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I decided, and quickly deleted all of my blogging and retreated into a fortress of privacy controls and paranoia.</p>

<p>You see, my concern was not unlike that of many others: What would happen if one of my blog entries was uncovered by a potential employer years into the future? Would I be denied a promotion, or even an initial offer, due to some knucklehead thing I said when I was seventeen? The risk, I decided, was not at all worth it. Blogging was a childish thing, and it was time for me to put away childish things and focus on the real world.</p>

<p>Over the next several years a lot changed on the Internet, not the least of which being the introduction of Facebook in 2004 &ndash; 05. Facebook, along with countless other sites, ultimately initiated an approach of attempting to limit or mitigate concerns about privacy by allowing users to filter content based on the degree of trust they place in the individual reader. The idea, essentially, is that users would be able to lead double lives: the Professional life they present to their employers, and the Personal life they share with their friends. The illusion was that maintaining such a distinction in a public setting was possible. It&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>We have been lead to believe for the past several years that the biggest problem with social use of the Internet is that it compromises our privacy and may put us in a precarious situation in our professional lives. We have been trained that we must adhere to stringent Privacy Settings and restricted networks. I now believe that this is the wrong approach.</p>

<p>Rather than try to use the Internet while constantly covering our tracks so that our true selves never become known we should be simply living our lives and being ourselves. The permanency and publicity of the Internet should not be forcing us to seek out enhanced privacy protections, but rather urging us to reconsider whether we are truly proud of the lives we are living. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t use an alias online. If I have an account, the username is ianhines. If I write a comment, I write my full name in the name field. If you Google &ldquo;Ian P. Hines,&rdquo; almost every item on the first two pages is me. When I blog, I blog from this URL in my own name. I want the people who I interact with online to know that I stand by what I say.</p>

<p>I think that if everyone stopped worrying about whether what they said was public, and starting thinking about whether they&rsquo;d be embarrassed if it was, we might get both a more civilized Internet and a more understanding society.</p>
