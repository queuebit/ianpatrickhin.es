        What is a “Modern Do-Gooder,” anyway?
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>Recently a number of people have asked me to explain what I mean when I call myself a &ldquo;Modern Do-Gooder.&rdquo; Considering the phrase is featured so prominently on this site I thought I&rsquo;d share my explanation.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;Modern Do-Gooder&rdquo; comes from a 2008&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/opinion/21brooks.html">opinion piece</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/davidbrooks/index.html?inline=nyt-per">David Brooks</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>. In the piece he describes the world-view and approach of what he characterizes as a new breed of &ldquo;social entrepreneurs.&rdquo; I find that the world view he articulates largely overlaps with my own and is articulated more eloquently and succinctly than I ever could.</p>

<p>To wit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier generations of benefactors thought that social service should be like sainthood or socialism. But this one thinks it should be like venture capital.</p>
<p>These thoroughly modern do-gooders dress like venture capitalists. They talk like them. They even think like them. That means that aside from the occasional passion for heirloom vegetables, they are not particularly crunchy. They don&rsquo;t wear ponytails, tattoos or Birkenstocks. They don&rsquo;t devote any energy to countercultural personal style, unless you consider excessive niceness a subversive fashion statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>It also means that they are not that interested in working for big, sluggish bureaucracies. They are not hostile to the alphabet-soup agencies that grew out of the New Deal and the Great Society; they just aren&rsquo;t inspired by them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The venture-capital ethos means instead that these social entrepreneurs are almost willfully blind to ideological issues. They will tell you, even before you have a chance to ask, that they are data-driven and accountability-oriented. They&rsquo;re always showing you multivariate regressions or explaining why some promising idea &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t pencil out.&rdquo; The highest status symbol in their circle is a Rand study showing that their program yields statistically significant results.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The older do-gooders had a certain policy model: government identifies a problem. Really smart people design a program. A cabinet department in a big building administers it.</p>
<p>But the new do-gooders have absorbed the disappointments of the past decades. They have a much more decentralized worldview. They don&rsquo;t believe government on its own can be innovative. A thousand different private groups have to try new things. Then we measure to see what works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I describe myself as a &ldquo;Modern Do-Gooder,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s this ethos that I am espousing:</p>

<ul>
<li>an orientation towards public service;</li>
<li>a belief in the power of the free-market of ideas;</li>
<li>a relentless focus on measurable results and accountability; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>a deep respect for people who pursue excellence in what they do.</li>
</ul>
