        Interview with Patrick Rhone

<article class="block">
  <p><a href="http://patrickrhone.com">Patrick Rhone</a> is a man who wears many hats. He&rsquo;s a writer, curator, father, and sage Mac consultant. You&rsquo;ve likely read his aptly named website, <a href="http://minimalmac.com">Minimal Mac</a>. And if you haven&rsquo;t, you should.</p>

<p>Patrick was kind enough to allow me to interview him. The interview was conducted via email between August 1 and October 4, 2010. Enjoy.</p>

<h2>The Interview</h2>

<p><strong>Ian P. Hines:</strong> Thanks for taking the time to be interviewed. I hope this be fun for you&mdash;I know it will be for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start where I start with everyone: at the beginning. How long have you kept a weblog, and what made you get started in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick Rhone:</strong> This sounds really wonderful and, as you know, I admire your talent as an interviewer greatly and think it deserves a home all its own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing at patrickrhone.com since November 2003. That said, for about 6 months before that, I was posting on a blog that was internal to to my employer at the time and patrickrhone.com was really started from that.</p>
<p>I have been a writer all of my life. I kept journals and published poetry as a teen. I was an English major in college. Even my entry into the &ldquo;tech world&rdquo; began with a ghost writing job responding to customer service letters for a major computer manufacturer in the pre-email days. I started the blog as a natural outgrowth of my drive to write and share that writing with others. It also was a handy way to keep my coworkers updated on the latest Mac news, tips and tricks when it was internal to my employer at the time. It quickly expanded to anything that captured my fancy and imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Neat. So for you, the writing preceded the blogging? For me it was the other way around: the idea of a weblog was captivating, and it led me to begin writing in a way I never had before.</p>

<p>You alluded keeping your coworkers updated on Mac news. You&rsquo;re perhaps best known as being a Mac guru&mdash;I&rsquo;m curious how that all got started for you? How did the young writer/poet become the &ldquo;Mac Guy?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Besides being a writer I was always interested in technology too. My earliest computer, as a teen, was a Timex Sinclair (really dating myself here). In fact, used some inheritance money that was meant for college to instead buy my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; computer &mdash; A custom built 486/50, which was the fastest and most expensive model of the time. I did all manner of geeing out with that machine. From running DR DOS (which was superior to MS DOS in many ways) to spending lots of time uploading my writing to BBSs for folks to see.</p>
<p>Following the ghost writing job, I got a job doing technical support for a high end laser printer manufacturer that catered to the Publishing industry. Because of this, I had to learn and support Mac as well as PC and I quickly fell in love. The geek side of me wanted to get to know this new tool as deeply as possible. The creative side of me was fascinated by the idea of WYSIWYG self publishing. From then on I was hooked and a full on Apple fanboy was born. I replaced my (now aging) PC with a Performa 550 and never looked back.</p>
<p>It was soon after this that a lightbulb went off in my head about the idea of being able to have my own consulting business helping people with this stuff. Every other career move that followed was made with that plan in mind. I&rsquo;ve worked for a digital delivery service for print and prepress, a Mac software company, and as the head of Mac stuff for a major college. Imreally wanted to learn and practice the skills I would need in order to achieve that goal. Now, I work for myself. My business, Machine Methods, has been helping people with technology, with a Macintosh focus, for over 10 years now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Wow, so how old were you when you realized that you wanted to own consulting business? It&rsquo;s a special thing to identify your dream and actually achieve it. Most people aren&rsquo;t that fortunate or determined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I think I was around 26 years old at the time I first started to think of it. It was not too long after that I actually committed to it. I had actually started taking on clients on the side by the time I was 30 but it was a couple of years (2000) before I actually filed the paperwork to officially register it as a business.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of those ten years I have had a full time job and my consulting business has been a &ldquo;side job&rdquo;. There was one disastrous year where I tried to live off of it alone, while being a single father to my two sons. I am still not quite sure how I made it through that year because my gross income was well bellow what a family of three should have been able to survive on.</p>
<p>That said, the day I decided to go back to a &ldquo;day job&rdquo; I had two job offers made to me practically on the spot. That was when I took the one that was the job at the college. I left that job a bit over 2 years ago now. I&rsquo;ve been doing Machine Methods full time ever since and faring much better this time around (Not the least of which is because I have a wife who is a successful consultant herself. Two incomes help).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> It sounds like it&rsquo;s been quite a journey, then. I&rsquo;ve always imagined being self-employed (as I imagine many people do) and it&rsquo;s nice to hear what that&rsquo;s actually like from someone who has done it.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m actually going to harp on the consulting business angle for a bit longer. You&rsquo;ve been involved in Mac consulting for long enough to have witnessed a massive shift in technology and style. How has that impacted not only your business, but the way you use the products personally? I&rsquo;d imagine it&rsquo;s a very, very different world for you now than it was in the beginning&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Well, astute readers of this interview may have noticed, by doing the math, that I decided to become a Macintosh consultant at a time when Apple&rsquo;s very future was uncertain and, by most accounts, unlikely. This was around the time the stock price was at it&rsquo;s lowest, Steve Jobs had not yet come back, Wired magazine was asking people to pray for Apple right on it&rsquo;s cover. The thought being that only divine intervention could save the company.</p>
<p>In hind sight, it may not have seemed the smartest move at the time to tie my career goals to a horse that had all but given up the race. I guess there must have been something there to tie my faith to and, after the purchase of NeXT and the return of Steve Jobs, I was a full fledged believer.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, in many ways my business is directly tied to Apple&rsquo;s success or failure. If people are not buying the products they are not calling me to help them use them. So I guess one big shift is not so much the technology but the growing success of Apple and my businesses continuing success with it.</p>
<p>This is not to underplay the technology in the least. There has been some real shifts there as well. Helping people with the transition from OS 9 to Mac OS X was a huge one. That kept me busy for a few years. The move from Power PC to Intel based systems as well, but not as much. Currently, mobile is exploding and I am getting an increasing number of calls about that stuff. The unseen story there is how much that is driving not only sales of new Macs but also new Mac users needing help making the transition.</p>
<p>To give you an example, summer is usually my slowest time. For ten years now I have been having to brace for the phone to stop ringing for my services around the middle of May. Why? Well, several reasons all related. People take more vacations. They are in the office later and out earlier to enjoy the weather. They even use their computers not working for an excuse not to work themselves. It&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;My Mac is wonky! Oh well, I guess that means I&rsquo;ll go to the beach&rdquo;. Then they call me urgently in September as if it&rsquo;s an emergency.</p>
<p>This summer, I&rsquo;m busy beyond belief. Lots of new Mac setups. Lots of help with iPhone and iPad. Lot&rsquo;s of genuine emergencies. Now, some of that is the economy. People can&rsquo;t afford to go to the beach and not work. That said, the economy is not stopping people from buying new Apple products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Well, if Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/08/08/mac-share-college">is right</a> about Apple&rsquo;s market share among college students it seems as though business will only continue to improve as we move forward.</p>

<p>I want to shift gears a bit and talk about your various blogs. You&rsquo;re one of the few writers I know who chooses to spread their work among many distinct blogs, each with a unique focus. Why that choice? And how does the separation affect your writing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> This is a simple question but the answer is complex. Partly because, in order to answer appropriately, I must explain the very core of how I approach each site.</p>
<p>First of all, not every site has this focus. In fact, my personal site (<a href="http://patrickrhone.com/">http://patrickrhone.com/</a>) and The Random Post (<a href="http://therandompost.com/">http://therandompost.com/</a>) specifically do not. The Random Post was started, as the name may suggest, to allow me the freedom to gather and link all of the stuff I&rsquo;m interested in or fascinated by that was not appropriate for any of my other sites. On my personal site, I largely allow myself to write long form essays about anything that has hold of my mind at the time.</p>
<p>That said, the others I see not simply as blogs but as acts of curation around a given topic area, with some of the curation being original content. I see this more in line with a context specific museum &ndash; like MOMA (<a href="http://moma.org/">http://moma.org/</a>) or gallery within a larger museum. These institutions collect the best representative work of a period or style and then present it &ndash;more often than not with commentary relating to it&rsquo;s history, importance, reason for selection, etc. I choose to do the same with Minimal Mac (<a href="http://minimalmac.com/">http://minimalmac.com/</a>) and Practical Opacity (<a href="http://practicalopacity.com/">http://practicalopacity.com/</a>) because the contexts and subjects at hand are deep enough to warrant curation around a theme.</p>
<p>I am a deeply curious person and find a wide range of topics interesting. That said, there are things that I find so thought-provoking, yet are also evolving, that I wish to explore them far more deeply, with greater focus, and for a longer period of time. In that case, it&rsquo;s own site is warranted.</p>
<p>Then there is Duchess Beatrix (<a href="http://duchessbeatrix.com/">http://duchessbeatrix.com/</a>), which I &ldquo;ghost write&rdquo; for my two and a half year old daughter. Which is mainly a foray into satire that will likely only last until she is able to type on her own and tell you what she really thinks. I hope to raise her well enough that you will not even notice the change of guard.</p>
<p>It is hard to say how any of the above affects my writing. I certainly look back at posts from even a year or two ago on any of my sites and feel as if my writing has improved significantly. I&rsquo;m sure the plethora of sites I have to write for and maintain keeps me writing more now then ever before. Anything done regularly will get better simply do to regular practice. Especially if you care enough to try to do it well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure the answer is as complex as you think. It sounds like you&rsquo;re fragmenting the content so that the integrity of each topic area is insulated and protected. In fact, it sounds like you&rsquo;re really implementing the advice <a href="http://merlinnmann.com">Merlin Mann</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.com">John Gruber</a> gave at SxSW <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/25/blogs-turbocharged">last year</a> : &ldquo;If everything is what you do then you&rsquo;re not really doing a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which is actually a great segue to <a href="http://minimalmac.com">Minimal Mac</a> , your aptly named project about simplifying the Mac experience. You recently entered your second year on the project, and by all accounts its been a wildly popular success. What was the source initial grain of sand that grew into this pearl of a website (to use a horribly hokey metaphor)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It really was <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2009/08/05/the-24-hour-idea/">a simple idea</a> , that came together quickly, and with very little forethought. As I was trying to drift off to sleep one evening, the words Minimal Mac popped into my head. It just so happened that it fit into some other ideas I had been pondering lately. Like the idea that the Mac OS comes, right out of the box, with some really great applications and just about everything most people would need to be happy and productive. In addition, I think that fact, and the power of the built in apps, is under reported and appreciated. Also, I have long been a fan and follower of minimalist as aesthetics and ideals. I love software that does things in the most simple and elegant way possible. It just seemed to all come together under that phrase.</p>
<p>I jumped up out of bed, registered the domain, went back to sleep, woke up the next day, and put it up and online. I waited a bit for the DNS to propagate then released it into the wild. Then, it just kind of took off. I kept posting and people kept reading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I actually first encountered you via (there&rsquo;s that word again!) Minimal Mac. I actually remember thinking how neat it was that the site had such a laser-like focus, such that the reader gets lost in the content (in a good way).</p>

<p>I remember a while back you wrote a post about how you organize your feed reader (I couldn&rsquo;t find the link, but I remember because I took your advice and haven&rsquo;t looked back). If we were to snatch your iPad from you, which reader app would we find, and what sites would be in it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> The link is <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2010/02/15/my-rss-system/">here</a> .</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on the iPhone and iPad. It&rsquo;s ability to send links to <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> and a myriad of other services or places is what allows me to keep up with as much stuff as I am able to.</p>
<p>As far as what sites; well, more than anyone really should. That said, I feel like, especially for the sites I maintain, I kind of have to sift through a lot of stuff to find relevant, interesting, and topical stuff. Of course, that could simply be the excuse I tell myself but my delusion has yet to fail me.</p>
<p>I think, instead, I would rather list just a few of the sites and writers that I am finding compelling lately. In fact, one would have a fairly well versed and curated collection if they only read these. Here they are in no particular order and with no commentary from me to persuade you:</p>

<p><a href="http://whowritesforyou.com/">First Today, Then Tomorrow</a></p>
<p><a href="http://onethingwell.org/">One Thing Well</a></p>
<p>That should give folks a good start. I&rsquo;ve got way more I could throw on that list. I&rsquo;m sure I might have some that should be there but I&rsquo;ve left out. Those are just the ones that were sticking up a bit higher for me right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> On a similar note, do you have any favorite blog posts / essays that you&rsquo;ve read over the years? The sort of thing that you read and think to yourself, &ldquo;Wow. I wish I could write that well.&rdquo;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Certainly. And it gets added to all the time it seems. I keep both a &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/594165220/text-playlist" target="_blank">text playlist</a>&rdquo; as Frank Chimero has come to call it and a list of items that I think are just clever words, sentences, paragraphs. Here are a few selections from my text playlist in no particular order. I also am choosing to provide no additional commentary on any item because they speak for themselves if you read them:</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Interesting. I&rsquo;d not seen Frank&rsquo;s post about the &ldquo;text playlist,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s a very compelling idea.</p>

<p>No surprise, but it definitely seems like there&rsquo;s a theme running through these essays of aspiring for excellence. I wonder, if you had the opportunity to send some advice to your younger self to read as you were first beginning to write on the web, what would it be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Focus on writing well. Read as many posts and books on writing as you need to learn the craft without letting it distract you from, well, writing. Because, after a certain point, no book or post or advice will ever help you as much as putting those words down.</p>
<p>Also learn how to edit your writing to turn it into something other than a collection of words ordered according to some universally agreed to rules. Because some of those rules should be broken. In fact, many should have never been agreed to in the first place. Because those rules can stifle you from finding your own voice if followed too rigidly. More often than not, what you will be editing out of your writing is the rules.</p>
<p>Spend at least twice as much time editing as you do writing. Slave over every detail, sweat every word and punctuation mark. Read what you write over and over again. In fact, never stop yourself from revisiting something you wrote and improving or expanding on it if you feel it would make it better. Even something as simple as adding a comma where there should have been one can change the feel of an entire essay.</p>
<p>Be curious about everything but find one or two things that your are insatiably curious about and interested in. A subject or two that you can never know too much, or think too deeply, about. Write about these things.</p>
<p>Also, ignore the numbers. Ignore the audience. Ignore the fact that, for a very long time, no one may be reading. Just make sure that you are. Be your own biggest fan (when warranted) and harshest critic (when warranted).</p>
<p>Finally, do what I say, not what I do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Assuming you follow your own advice, what does your normal writing process look like? What do you do first, then second? What tools do you use? Where do you work? Paint me a picture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> The first thing I do is think very deeply about what I wish to say and how. It does not look very much like writing. It looks a whole lot more like being distracted and disconnected from everything happening around me. It is a very different state than my normal one, in which I strive for mindfulness. Anyone who knows me now knows when I&rsquo;m &ldquo;writing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens while having conversations about these thoughts I&rsquo;m thinking about. These conversations very often offer up even more directions I had not thought about. Sometimes, all of the &ldquo;writing&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ve been doing gets thrown out and rewritten.</p>
<p>Then, I will attempt to capture these thoughts as they coalesce &mdash; by any means at my disposal &mdash; into some rough scribbles, sketches, scrawls. Most of the time that is via pen and paper but often it is in Simplenote on my iPhone. The goal is anything that will let me capture them quickly. I have a very poor memory and high lack of focus and ideas often get lost between my mind and my ability to get them down (These frustrate me deeply. I&rsquo;m nearly in tears right now even thinking about it) Sometimes it is a single word or sentence. Rarer times, it is a whole (shitty, first) draft, fully formed.</p>
<p>The tools change depending on where I am when I&rsquo;m ready to really write. Sometimes I&rsquo;m at my laptop and using Notational Velocity. Sometimes I use TextEdit. If it requires a lot of formatting (which I do with Markdown), I use TextMate. If I&rsquo;m on my iPad or iPhone I&rsquo;m using Simplenote pretty exclusively.</p>
<p>There is one constant though, I write everything in plain text. I have been around this whole digital thing for a long time. I&rsquo;ve seen too many formats die. I&rsquo;ve lost too much. Remember AmiPro? Claris Works? Wordstar? I have years of writing that I will likely never see again because I used something, it died (i.e. Stopped being made or supported), and there is no reasonable way for me to open those files and get it back. I won&rsquo;t ever make that mistake again. If your program can&rsquo;t save or export my data in plain text, I will likely not use it.</p>
<p>As for location, well, anywhere I&rsquo;m able. As I stated above, I need a place to focus and be distraction low (Are we really ever distraction free?). I tend to be a night owl and do most of my best work after 10PM until I collapse. Therefore, do to that timing, I&rsquo;d say 80% of what makes it out to the world is finished at my desk in my home office.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take this opportunity to confess that I have never been happy with my home office. Neither it&rsquo;s arrangement or location. It is in our third floor loft, an attic that was converted into a large open space. The space itself is nice, we live in an old Victorian home so it has these very high peaked ceilings. It is also our bedroom for now while we slowly work on refinishing the room that will be our master bedroom. Having my workspace so close to my rest space is one of the things that bugs me. The other is I would be far more comfortable in a space that was more intimate. Also, one that felt like it was &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and not shared. My hope is that, once we get that bedroom done, I can have my office in the room next door that is currently our guest room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> A couple of thoughts. First, about how long does it normally take you to develop an idea from a note in Simplenote to a published work? Or does it vary dramatically, depending on your availability and the particular idea?</p>

<p>Second, how does your wife deal with your late night writing? I have the same predisposition to late-night work (largely because it&rsquo;s when my one-year old is asleep and I can focus), but I invariably wake my wife up when I come to bed (and, occasionally, the baby).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It really does vary wildly. Some things really do come fully formed while others are simply another entry in a note I have labeled &ldquo;Post ideas&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That said, let&rsquo;s take one of the later as a for instance. I&rsquo;ll even take one that is actually in there. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;My Neighborhood: A Love Story&rdquo;. Now, I know exactly what I want to do. I want to write a rundown of every shop and place in my neighborhood that makes me love where I live. That includes the wonderful natural foods co-op grocery that is two blocks away, the fantastic little (expensive) mens boutique that is a half block down from there, the bar with a beer selection that generally runs in the hundreds, and this is just the beginning. Now, I know basically what I want to say about each place, just not how to say it. I also have toyed with the idea of it being a video post but keep backing off of that one when I think about the time versus my relative lack of skill in that department. So, because it is not quite settled it sits. Then, at some future point, I&rsquo;m sure a burst of inspiration will hit and I will sit and write it in a hour or two and then spend a day or so editing and massaging it.</p>
<p>Now, there are various works in progress and fully formed posts in there as well. This said, most start like I have described above.</p>
<p>As far as working hours, my wife is pretty good about it. She is the type that falls asleep as easily as she wakes. If she does wake up when I come to be late she can get right back to sleep. Since my office is in the same area as the bedroom, I do relocate to another part of the house once she goes to bed as not to keep her awake with my clickity-clacking.</p>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Last question: Could you share one piece of advice&ndash;perhaps a lesson you&rsquo;ve learned from experience&ndash;that you&rsquo;ve found invaluable? Regardless of whether it&rsquo;s relevant to the topics we&rsquo;ve covered. Bestow some wisdom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> If it were anything, it would be the value of time.</p>
<p>Time is the most valuable and finite commodity that any living thing has. Think about it, everything &ndash; you, me, people, plants, animals, even the Earth itself &ndash; has a limited and set amount of time. From the moment we come into existence, we begin an inevitable march to a final end. Even the age of our solar system exists in but a minute of time within the context of the history of the universe. The average human lifespan does not even register on that clock. With that said, in many ways, time is the very definition of life itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, treat it as it is &ndash; the most precious thing in existence. Don&rsquo;t squander a single second. Perhaps, even more importantly, don&rsquo;t waste time regretting the time you squander or lose. Instead, look to how you are going to use this very moment to do something&hellip; Anything. Enjoy a simple breath, or make a memorable mark. Don&rsquo;t worry about the next until the next comes along. This moment is far too important.</p>
