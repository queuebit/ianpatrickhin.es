<p><strong>My wife:&nbsp;</strong>I think I am going through the nesting phase.</p>
<p><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong>Nesting phase?</p>
<p><strong>My wife:&nbsp;</strong>You know, wanting to get the house all ready for the new baby&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong>Ah. Well, if you&rsquo;re nesting then I must be trying to find the right tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I go any further, let me make one thing clear: from the moment you lay eyes on that ultrasound (if it even takes you that long) everything else in your life takes a back-seat to what is best for your child.</p>

<p>This September I will be having my first child, a son. I haven&rsquo;t even met him yet and I already know he&rsquo;s the best thing since pockets. I know that&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s going to have two parents who love him to death, and that he&rsquo;s going to get all the care and attention he could ask for. What I don&rsquo;t know (to be entirely blunt) is the practical stuff: where will he sleep, play, and learn?</p>

<h2>Nesting</h2>

<p>My wife is on top of the first two. She&rsquo;s busy scouting out children&rsquo;s furniture and rearranging our house to make room for him and all the various items that having a baby invariably bring to your home. I guess the term for this is nesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Around the fifth month of pregnancy, the &ldquo;nesting&rdquo; instinct can set in. This is an uncontrollable urge to clean one&rsquo;s house brought on by a desire to prepare a nest for the new baby, to tie up loose ends of old projects and to organize your world. (via&nbsp;<a title="Link to 'Parenting Weekly'" href="http://www.parentingweekly.com/pregnancy/pregnancy_information/nesting_instinct.htm" target="_blank">Parenting Weekly</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most wild thing about it is that it started almost&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;at the beginning of the fifth month: the pressure started to increase to make sure the house stayed in top shape, and the shopping for baby furniture took on a whole new level of immediacy. It&rsquo;s almost as though it happened on cue.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty entertaining to watch, actually. We live in a fairly tiny Baltimore rowhouse (less than 1,000 sq. ft.), and though by Manhattan standards it&rsquo;s quite spacious in reality no one takes Manhattan&rsquo;s standards on real estate livability seriously anyway. It&rsquo;s a great space for the two of us&mdash;the floor plan is very open&mdash;but projects to be a nightmare for a family with children. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we&rsquo;re doing a great job of rethinking the space to incorporate the baby&rsquo;s things: we actually have a fair amount of wholly underutilized space as it is. But the writing on the wall is clear as day that&nbsp;<strong>we&rsquo;re rapidly outgrowing our house</strong>.</p>

<h2>Finding the Right Tree</h2>

<p>My wife may be focused on nesting our home, but I&rsquo;ve developed a laser-like focus on figuring out what to do when we outgrow it. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy enough at the outset:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to move to a bigger place,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll say. But it&rsquo;s from there that all the questions start emerging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&rdquo;</strong>Where will you find this bigger place? What kind of neighborhood do you want to live in? Will you live in the suburbs or stay in the city? How much home can you afford, anyway? Where will your child go to school? What about safety? What sort of lifestyle do you want to live, as a familiy? Etc. Etc. Etc.<strong>&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially these questions seem practical, of course: you&rsquo;re trying to find a new home and need to give it thought. But you soon realize that you&rsquo;re not thinking about a home at all, you&rsquo;re thinking about a life. You&rsquo;re trying to imagine how your<em>new</em>&nbsp;life will look, mapping out how to get there, and quickly realizing that it is incredibly complicated.Frequently the goals you are seeking to achieve seem at odds with one another, and rarely ever do they seem to come without a cost.</p>

<p>For my wife, nesting is about preparing the home for the baby. For me, nesting is about assessing priorities and getting into a state of mind where what&rsquo;s best for your child comes first.</p>
