        Six months of freelancing
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>As of today, <a href="/wrote/freelancing">I have been freelancing for six months</a>. Going into this adventure — and it has been an adventure — I wasn’t sure I’d even make it a month, so this is a huge deal. In the past six months I’ve had 33 clients, three site redesigns, and a cross country move. It’s been the thrill of a lifetime, but it hasn’t all been a breeze.</p>

<p>One of the scariest things about taking the leap and becoming a freelancer is the uncertainty. You aren’t certain where the work will come from, or if it will come at all. You aren’t certain that you’re “good enough” to be worth hiring on your own. You’re just nervous. Because it’s scary.</p>

<p>Before I became a freelancer, I took a lot of inspiration in reading the stories of other freelancers’ experiences. The fact that they were learning, too, put me at ease. It could work. They were proof.</p>

<p>And so today, on my six-month anniversary, I’d like to share some things I’ve learned in the hopes that they’ll be a help to others. (These are in no particular order.)</p>

<h3>Admin / Business Development</h3>

<p>You’re going to spend far more time on business development than you expect. Over-budget that time. You won’t get paid for it, but you sure won’t get paid without it.</p>

<p>I can end up spending anywhere between 30–50% of my week on admin and business development. It’s part of the reason I’ve started making my pricing transparent: I can’t afford the time it takes to haggle.</p>

<h3>Don’t overbook</h3>

<p>There’s a tendency when you’re starting out to want to take on every job that comes your way. That’s understandable. But be careful not to over-commit. You’ll regret it.</p>

<p>When I talk to clients, I compare freelancing to high school. (Bear with me.) In high school, you have several teachers that assign homework, but none of them coordinate with one another. As a result, some nights you have nothing to do… and that’s great. But on some nights, you have three assignments due the next day and can’t possibly give them all your best effort.</p>

<p>Freelancing can be like that if you carry too many clients at once, and that’s no good for anyone. Figure out how much work you can handle at a time, and limit yourself to that. For me, that’s 2–3 concurrent projects. For you, it will be something different. The point isn’t to follow my limit, the point is to find your own limits and stick to them.</p>

<h3>You’re not going to charge enough</h3>

<p>Always remember: you need to price your work based on value, not on cost.</p>

<p>Does it take you a week to complete? An hour? It doesn’t matter. Price it based on how valuable it is to your client. How much is the result of your work worth to them? That’s the number.</p>

<p>Since I’ve started freelancing, I’ve tried a number of different <a href="http://www.ianpatrickhines.com/pricing">pricing models</a>. I’ve also raised my rates three times. And guess what? I’m still getting new clients.</p>

<p>It’s natural for you to undervalue your own work. If at all possible, try to get a third-party perspective for the market value of what you’re providing and price from there.</p>

<h3>There are always more clients</h3>

<p>Early on, it will feel like every prospective client that contacts you is a humungous deal. You <em>have</em> to get this client. You <em>need</em> this work. The thing is, there are always more clients.</p>

<p>Know your own value and your own availability, and stick to it. If the potential client balks, then they were the wrong client for you. There will be more. Don’t worry.</p>

<p>I have compromised on my own pricing for <em>must have</em> projects, and each time I regretted it. When you undercut your own pricing, clients tend to undervalue what they’re getting in return. They’ll keep asking for more, because you’ve communicated that everything is negotiable. And perhaps most importantly, you won’t be earning what you’re worth.</p>

<h3>Get a room with a desk and a door</h3>

<p>When I first started freelancing, I was working out of our dining room. That was a disaster. I had trouble focusing, my back hurt, and the background noise made me sound unprofessional on the phone.</p>

<p>Now, I have an “office” across the hall from my bedroom — and it makes a world of difference. It may seem like an unnecessary expense, but investing in a good working environment is well worth the money. You’ll be spending most of your time there. Make it comfortable.</p>

<h3>Most of all, treat people well</h3>

<p>You’re not a businessman. You’re a business, man — and <em>your reputation is all you have</em>.</p>

<p><ul><li>Treat people like you want to be treated.</li>
<li>Be honest.</li>
<li>Say thank you.</li>
<li>Keep records of who refers you business, and repay them in kindness and favors.</li>
<li>Over-communicate with your clients. (People are rarely angry because of too much clarity.)</li>
<li>Keep your promise. In fact, under-promise and over-deliver.</li>
<li>Say “no” more often than you say “yes.” It’s hard at first, but it gets easier. And people will appreciate the honesty more than they’ll appreciate your unfulfilled commitments.</li>
</ul><h3>Closing</h3></p>

<p>I hope you found this helpful / interesting. I wrote it for me from six months ago, so if you’re like I was you probably loved it.</p>

<p>I sure don’t have all the answers, but that’s the point. I’m learning every day. Running a business is hard, but it’s also possible. And you don’t have to know all the answers to get started.</p>
