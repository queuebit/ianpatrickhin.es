<article class="block">
  <p><a title="Shawn Blanc" href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> is one of the best writers on the web. You probably know him from his top notch <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/reviews/">software reviews</a>, wonderful <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/sweet-mac-setups/">Sweet Mac Setups</a> series or, more recently, for his thoughtful commentary on <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/category/writing/">writing itself</a>.</p>

<h3>The Interview</h3>

<p><strong>Ian P. Hines:</strong> Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning: How long have you kept a weblog, and what made you get started in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn Blanc:</strong> I remember writing my first post as if I published it yesterday. I so clearly recall the first time I felt the novelty of writing something combined with the adrenaline rush of publishing it. Even now, five years later, I still feel that same novelty and that same rush every time I publish a new article.</p>
<p>That first post was written on January 27, 2006 during a trip to Colorado. I wrote it on my 12-inch PowerBook G4 and published it on Blogspot.</p>
<p>(Back then, all my blogging friends used Blogspot. Randy had been publishing his weblog for like 6 years already, and Josh was going on three or four I think. About six months later I migrated my blog to WordPress (version 2.1 I think) because the WordPress WYSISYG editor seemed way better than Blogspot&rsquo;s.)</p>
<p>I have always considered myself a writer, despite the fact that until I began publishing a weblog in 2006 I had barely done any consistent writing. (Funny how it works like that.) So perhaps that is why I still recall that first post so much &mdash; I had finally begun writing.</p>
<p>Publishing a weblog has been the best thing I could have done for my writing. It is a format that really works for me: I enjoy it, I&rsquo;m challenged by it, inspired by it, and frustrated by it. I love it and I hate it. Some days I cannot wait to sit down at my keyboard, while other days I consider quitting altogether building furniture instead. And but so the blend of emotion is sort of my proof that I ought to keep growing and writing.</p>
<p>But if I ever did quit, I know I would miss it. Blogging in its purest form &mdash; when I am not being influenced by stats, etc. &mdash; is really enjoyable to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> It&rsquo;s interesting that you mention the tension between loving blogging and thinking of quitting; I gather that that is a common feeling among dedicated bloggers. I&rsquo;m curious how your blogging influences your professional and personal life, and visa versa? Would you say that you continue blogging in spite of its impact on your offline life, or because of it, or&hellip; what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Publishing my website influences my home and work life much the same as any other pursuit would.</p>
<p>Growing up and all through school I studied Martial Arts, and that affected my whole life. I trained five days a week, and everything I did or thought revolved around Tae Kwon Do. My friends were in Martial Arts, we only ever watched fight movies, I read books about weapons and Japan and ninjas (seriously), and I made sure to buy clothes that would be most appropriate in case I were to get into a fight in a back alley.</p>
<p>After that it was playing the drums. From my senior year of high school, on through college, and for my first five years on staff with the International House of Prayer I was a full-time drummer. My best friends were my bandmates, I visited drum websites, watched drum-solo videos on YouTube, spent all my money on drum gear, and listened to a lot of Carter Beauford.</p>
<p>It was in 2007 when I began transitioning out of my life as a drummer and into a life of graphic design, writing, and much higher interest in technology, software, and the creative arts.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s not as cut and dry as I&rsquo;ve made it sound &mdash; I am still a Black Belt, I still own my drum kit, and I was writing and designing and being nerdy before 2007. But my point here is that there are seasons of my life which can clearly be earmarked by what hobby or pursuit I most had going at the time, and usually for a decade or more. Each of these pursuits had a profound impact on my daily life.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, I write both in spite of, and because of, its impact on my offline life. I mean, of course it impacts my offline life. If it didn&rsquo;t it would mean I wasn&rsquo;t putting enough of myself into it. If I didn&rsquo;t want my online writing to have an effect on my offline life then I suppose I ought to go find something which I would.</p>
<p>The reason I sometimes consider quitting is probably just like anyone else who considers quitting something they do. There is always that feeling of the grass being greener on the other side. Will I be publishing my site 10 years from now? I don&rsquo;t know. But I do know that for this season of life I have the time and the energy to write and I want to make the most of it so that when I look back it won&rsquo;t be to see time wasted fiddling around on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Well said. But how about we flip it around: how does your offline life influence your writing?</p>

<p>Back in early February you published a piece titled &ldquo;A Job Should Also Be an Education&rdquo; in which you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My uncertainties, struggles, and discoveries as the director of a marketing and creative team are something I&rsquo;d very much like to talk about more here on shawnblanc.net, but I honestly don&rsquo;t know where to begin.</p>
<p>I started to briefly in &ldquo;Marketing Shoes&rdquo; and in my responses to Cameron Moll&rsquo;s questions on leading an in-house design team. And posting my 1:1 form was another attempt at it.</p>
<p>But talking about management, leadership, marketing strategy, and creative solutions from a corporate-feeling, non-profit organization&rsquo;s standpoint is something I don&rsquo;t feel very smart in. (And I generally prefer to only talk about things which I feel very smart in.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, for one, would love to hear more about your work at the International House of Prayer, your hobbies, etc., but that doesn&rsquo;t seem like something you&rsquo;re inclined to focus on at SBnet.</p>

<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m really asking is: how do you decide what to &mdash; and what not to &mdash; write about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Well, I primarily decide what not to write about by wimping out &mdash; sometimes before I even get started. Or sometimes mid-way through.</p>
<p>I think to myself: &ldquo;Self, nobody cares about this crap. It&rsquo;s not worth your time to write it, and it&rsquo;s certainly not worth anyone else&rsquo;s time to read. You and they both have something better to do.&rdquo; Perhaps I&rsquo;m being hard on myself at those times, or perhaps it truly is the voice of reason. We may never know.</p>
<p>How do I decide what to write? No clue. I just write it I guess. There is no content strategy or research plan. I just write whenever I have a clear thought that I&rsquo;d like to communicate. If I get stuck during the process of working out that thought then I&rsquo;ll save it as a draft in MarsEdit and re-visit it later. More often than not I do come back to that post, finalize it, and publish it.</p>
<p>And actually, I am inclined to talk more about my work on my weblog. Although that inclination has yet to translate into actual posts. As of this writing I have a handful of draft articles started which are not related to Apple or technology at all &mdash; they&rsquo;re about marketing, the creative workflow, and management. Hopefully one or more of them will get finished and published soon and will pave the way for more of the like to follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Hmm&hellip; That leads me to an interesting thought: roughly how many draft articles do you have in MarsEdit right now? I tend never to have more than a few at a time, mostly because I find that when I get an idea it gnaws at me until I publish it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Roughly 30. The oldest dates back to June 2008. Most of the drafts are only one or two sentences, and are simply the start of a thought. Others are hundreds of words yet still incomplete, and a few are would-be/could-be links.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Do you find that &mdash; at least in your personal opinion &mdash; you write better when the idea pours out of you or when you take more time to write it in drafts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> I guess it depends on the definition of writing better. If I have an idea that just pours out then yes, the initial foundation for what I&rsquo;m writing is certainly much stronger than an idea I&rsquo;m unclear on and trying to winkle through. But a piece that I were to write quickly and then publish would not nearly be as well written as one I took the time to write, edit, re-write, and then edit some more.</p>
<p>In my opinion, my strongest articles are ones which I spend a significant amount of time on (sometimes several weeks) before publishing. Some of those articles started as an idea that just &ldquo;poured out&rdquo;, but some of them didn&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Makes sense. I&rsquo;ve never really been much for drafts in any context; even major academic papers are usually just written in one go-through. I tend to edit as I go (for better or for worse).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Yeah, I tend to edit as I go too. And I hate that I do that. It slows me down and I don&rsquo;t even think it leads to a better first draft.</p>
<p>When I edit as I go I have too much focus on writing well and not just writing. That&rsquo;s Natalie Goldberg&rsquo;s big thing in her book &ldquo;Writing Down the Bones&rdquo; &mdash; she is always saying to just write. Write. Write!</p>
<p>The trouble with editing as I go is that I lose track of where I&rsquo;m going because I focus too much on where I&rsquo;ve been. Even now, as I&rsquo;m typing this answer at this moment I&rsquo;m editing it as I go. (!!) For me, it&rsquo;s a habit I want to kick but it&rsquo;s easier written than done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> You are, I&rsquo;d wager, best known for your glowing and fantastically spot-on app reviews. In fact I feel like I&rsquo;ve seen you refer to yourself as a software evangelist. How did you come to start writing those?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Thanks for the kind words, though I can&rsquo;t ever remember referring to myself as a &ldquo;software evangelist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How exactly I fell into writing those winded reviews I&rsquo;m not really sure. Though I do know it all started with my review of NetNewsWire. I wanted to write something of length that had a storyline, yet was chock full of nerdy content. A review of an app that I love seemed like the perfect solution. And it was.</p>
<p>For me, writing a software review isn&rsquo;t so much about giving the ins and outs of an application. It&rsquo;s about telling a story and sharing a point of view from my eyes and then weaving the piece of software into that storyline.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am very much interested in how computers serve the creative process. I enjoy discovering the junction between the artful and the technical. Since software is one of the premier tools found at that junction, looking at the storyline and communicating the ins and outs of a specific tool is very rewarding for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Do you usually know you want to write a review as soon as, or before, you start using a new piece of software? Or does the urge to review it come after you&rsquo;ve used it for some time and fallen in love with it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> After I&rsquo;ve used it. I don&rsquo;t like to write a review just for the sake of writing a review. Nor do I like to write reviews that are simply a drive-by list of features. So many of us interact with our computers (PCs, iPads, iPhones, etc..) more than any other items we own. And we literally form relationships and lifestyle habits with and around the software we use every day. That is the sort of thing I enjoy writing about. The relationship, the habits, the joy (and/or frustration) of using a piece of software day in and day out to get the job done and create something.</p>
<p>But you can only write about that relationship if you&rsquo;ve actually experienced it for yourself. You can&rsquo;t describe Paris without going there first. Without knowing what it&rsquo;s like to live with the software your reviewing then you&rsquo;re just listing feature and describing hypothetical use-case scenarios instead of sharing your own, personal, real-life experiences.</p>
<p>What I see as one of the biggest challenges in tech writing is to write substantive content. I am in no way harping on the guys who do write drive-by reviews &mdash; there is a lot of value to those types of reviews (I know I read them often) &mdash; but those are not the sort of reviews that I want to write. I don&rsquo;t want my article to become outdated as soon as the app gets its next major update.</p>
<p>In an interview I did <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2008/02/interview-john-gruber/">with John Gruber</a> a few years back we touched on this briefly. John said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite quotes of all time, probably my very favorite, is this one from Stanley Kubrick: &ldquo;Sometimes the truth of a thing is not so much in the think of it, as in the feel of it.&rdquo; A lot of times when I&rsquo;m reviewing something, what I&rsquo;m trying to do is capture the feel of it, rather than the think of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I&rsquo;ve bought a number of applications due to your reviews (Yojimbo, Things, Mint, Fever, etc.). I wonder, where do you go for feedback before you make a decision to invest your time and money into new software?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> I want to read something entertaining and in-depth written by someone who is, at the least, narrowly familiar with the software they are writing about. John Gruber used to write software reviews like this. His reviews of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/01/safari">Safari 1</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/09/bbedit_8">BBEdit 8</a> are both fantastic examples of a substantive, in-depth, and entertaining tech writing. His PowerBook review in 2005, &ldquo; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/11/full_metal_jacket">Full Metal Jacket</a> ,&rdquo; is perhaps my favorite DF article of all time. What makes articles John&rsquo;s so substantive is the depth of entertainment and information given to the reader even if they&rsquo;re not specifically interested in application being written about. The article isn&rsquo;t a list of features, its a story and a narrative that uses the product as a conversation topic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no sites I follow which have a regular history of producing in-depth, substantive reviews. Though many, many websites write reviews, they are usually short and in bullet-point format. They write four or five a day. Or ten. It&rsquo;s not too difficult to peck out a list of features and follow it with a list of opinions. And though drive-by reviews and &ldquo;first looks&rdquo; are good enough in their own right, they are rarely the sort of article I would send to Instapaper or save and reference seven years later.</p>
<p>And so when looking for feedback before I usually just go to Twitter or Google. Sometimes there is a particular app I&rsquo;m looking for feedback on, but usually I don&rsquo;t know what app I&rsquo;m looking for. I only know there is a problem I&rsquo;m trying to solve and I need a yet-unknown-to-me application to solve that problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> That reminds me of an article ( <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/books/20011230mccullough1230fnp2.asp"> http://www.post-gazette.com/books/20011230mccullough1230fnp2.asp </a> ) I once read about David McCullough, the author, which said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;he remembered the words of Thornton Wilder, the playwright and novelist who was his adviser at Yale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilder said he got the idea for a book or a play when he wanted to learn about something. Then, he&rsquo;d check to see if anybody had already done it, and it they hadn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like you write reviews for essentially the same reason. It&rsquo;s the same reason that Gruber writes Daring Fireball. He got tired of waiting for someone else to fill the void of writing quality articles about the topics he knows and loves, so he did it himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Yes and no. I write because I enjoy it. I enjoy taking complex systems or ideas and turning them into something simple and understandable. The reviews I write are like puzzles that I get to solve. Taking a problem and a solution and communicating that in a way that is engaging and understandable.</p>
<p>And I would say that John Gruber writes Daring Fireball not because there was a void in tech blogging, but because he is a writer. In my aforementioned <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2008/02/interview-john-gruber/">interview with John</a> I also asked him about why he began writing DF. His answer was simply that he loved to write and starting a weblog was an ideal and &ldquo;obvious outlet&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Which reminds me, I&rsquo;ve noticed over the last few weeks that the writing on shawnblanc.net has really picked up in both pace and quality. Noticeably more, and noticeably better. What happened?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Thank you. I&rsquo;ve noticed that as well, but I don&rsquo;t know if can pinpoint what has changed. There are several things I&rsquo;ve been more conscious of lately, and perhaps they&rsquo;re contributing. For one, I&rsquo;ve been intentionally less hard on editing what I write. I have often times written something and then edited it into ashes until there was nothing left and so I just deleted it.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve made a focused effort to spend less time in my inboxes and more time in my text editor. I am reading less RSS feeds, checking twitter less often, ignoring more email, and trying to write more. And the whole flywheel seems to be helping itself as I feel like I have more ideas, more clarity on them, and writing them seems a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s just that after six years of near-daily blogging I&rsquo;ve finally had a very slight breakthrough in spitting out what it is I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I&rsquo;ve also been paying less attention to the non-essential &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in my many inboxes, but for me the impetus has been a dramatic increase in my professional work load. I just don&rsquo;t have the time anymore. And for me I&rsquo;m seeing the exact opposite feedback loop: more time and attention spent on my work is improving the quality of my work, but at the expense of my hobbies. So I guess I know what you mean, sort of.</p>

<p>Shifting gears, I googled you recently (I think for the first time) and noticed, much to my surprise, that you have more websites than just shawnblanc.net. Would you mind sharing a bit about The Fight Spot and The Blanc Spot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> The Fight Spot is that very first weblog I mentioned at the beginning of our interview; it&rsquo;s what I wrote before I started shawnblanc.net. The Blanc Spot is the website for Anna and I and our ministry involvement with the International House of Prayer. But actually The Blanc Spot was *originally* what The Fight Spot morphed into.</p>
<p>The story goes like this.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, I first began publishing a blog in January of 2006. It was on Blogger, and since the individual site domains were sitting in blogspot.com URLs I thought &ldquo;The Blanc Spot&rdquo; would fit in well. After 6 months on Blogger I got my own domain and hosting and migrated the Blogger site into a self-hosted WordPress site instead. (Back then you could *only* do self-hosted WordPress blogs.)</p>
<p>The Blanc Spot blog eventually changed it&rsquo;s name to The Fight Spot so my wife and I could use the former as the name of our newsletter.</p>
<p>Before I started shawnblanc.net in 2007, the majority of the content I wrote was personal stories and musings. The site had a lot of reader interaction from the few hundred readers and it was fun. But more and more I wanted to write about technology. One day I wrote a review about a desktop blog publishing app called Ecto and many of the comments on that post were along the lines of, &ldquo;why are you posting this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I decided to start shawnblanc.net. It would be my avenue for writing in-depth articles on software and technology, productivity tools, and the creative arts. That was in July of 2007. It&rsquo;s fun to see how writing on all those same topics has become so very popular now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> And, paradoxically, how much less common it is to see people writing personal musing and stories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> Well, I think yes and no. I mean, just look at Tumblr or wordpress.com. I have no facts to prove this statement on but I think you (and most reading this) would agree when I say that the ratio of personal bloggers to professional bloggers has evened out over the past few years. Also, with the growth of Twitter and Facebook, people are using that as the outlet for what used to be their personal blogs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Stepping away from the web for a minute, I&rsquo;d like to ask you a bit about your work. You say on your site that you work &ldquo;full-time as Head Cheese of marketing and design.&rdquo; There are a lot of folks&ndash;-myself included&mdash;who have a love for design but, for whatever reason, have never really acquired design skills. We work with designers, but are not designers ourselves.</p>

<p>What does a typically day look like for you? What does your work really entail? And what skills&mdash;soft or hard&mdash;would you say are the most important in making you successful on any given day?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> My early mornings are spent at home preparing for the day. With just a fresh pot of coffee as my companion I spend time alone in quiet. I also scrub my to-do list, scan Twitter for anything exciting, and briefly check my email for anything urgent.</p>
<p>Mid morning I head over to the International House of Prayer for a prayer meeting. The prayer meetings have been going for 24 hours a day since 1999 and they combine music with the prayer. It&rsquo;s a fantastic place, and I love the fact that part of my job includes working alongside these missionaries.</p>
<p>The second half of my day is usually filled with meetings and consultations with my peer departments or internal customers. If I don&rsquo;t have any pre-scheduled meetings I head over to my office to hang out with my team. There are 16 of us that make up the Marketing Department and we function as the in-house design, web, and editorial staff. All branding, writing, print and web designing, and web development is managed through our office.</p>
<p>At the office I go through the day&rsquo;s emails, and work on my next-steps for current projects. But really a lot of my time is simply spent helping, critiquing, and working along side my team. As different members of my team have questions about things they are working on, or need approval for taking their project to the next phase, I am there to help.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, on Fridays, I almost always work from home. I try to go offline and spend the day working on the high-level goals. Not every Friday is spent that way. Sometimes I am just finally catching up on the week&rsquo;s email, or I am reviewing all the tasks that didn&rsquo;t get done that week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> So is your role primarily managerial? Long-term vision &amp; big picture? Or do you have particular areas of hands-on work that are primarily yours?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> All of the above.</p>
<p>As the head of my department I am in charge of hiring and firing, the overall budget, approving schedules, etc. Most of the day-to-day management is done by my operations director who manages nearly all of our projects.</p>
<p>I am also in charge of the big-picture and am the one who plans virtually all of our marketing campaigns. And I give direction to nearly everything we do that relates to any form of communication at all. Though that does not mean I am the only and final word on all marketing. I have a small team of other department heads I work with when planning major campaigns. And, of course, everything substantial gets sign off from my boss.</p>
<p>And lastly, there are many times when I have hands-on work within the office. For instance, this past December, we had our annual young adult conference: onething. We are currently short on print designers, so I spent a lot of my nights and weekends personally designing the conference guide handout.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Just the other day you organized, rather swifty, #pastblast&ndash;a day where everyone was asked to share links from the archives of their favorite sites.</p>

<p>I participated, and thought it was awesome. What gave you the idea, and how do you think it turned out?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> It was 100% spontaneous, and I think it turned out great.</p>
<p>It started while I was consolidating my Yojimbo bookmarks and prepping for my taxes (I keep all digital receipts in Yojimbo). I got sidetracked and began perusing through my bookmark tags for &ldquo;faves&rdquo;, &ldquo;tips&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo;. These are simply website bookmarks of articles and sites that I want to save to re-visit when I&rsquo;m in need of inspiration, helpful info, or whatever else.</p>
<p>As I was going through the bookmarks I was really enjoying the older articles again. I decided I would pick out a handful of them and link them up on my site the next day. I jumped onto Twitter to announce that I would be linking old articles on shawnblanc.net tomorrow, when I figured why not invite everyone else to do the same. You and a bunch of of others said yes to the invitation and it turned into something very fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> It certainly was very fun. Thanks for thinking of it.</p>
