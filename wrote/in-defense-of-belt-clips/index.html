      <h1>
        In Defense of Belt Clips
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>A few weeks ago there was some talk around the Internet about the geekiness of belt clips. <a title="'Where do I put my cell phone?' on Put This On" href="http://putthison.com/post/1453995474/q-and-answer-where-do-i-put-my-cell-phone-eric">Adam Lisagor</a> and <a title="'Put This On: Where do I put my cell phone?' by Ben Brooks" href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/11/cellphone-style/">Ben Brooks</a> both posted pieces about the cell phone belt clip being the &ldquo;pocket protector of our generation.&rdquo; Well, maybe it is. But I just don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>I wear a belt clip. Sometimes I wear two. I carry an iPhone for my personal use and a BlackBerry Curve for work. When you carry two phones like that and you&rsquo;re in and out of them every few minutes it really helps to have them easily reachable on your belt.</p>

<p>Thanks to my belt clip I always know where my phone is. I have muscle memory to grab it quickly. When one of them goes off&mdash;I have them set to vibrate&mdash;I know whether I need to answer it right away or ignore it because I can tell which of them it is without looking.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like to carry two phones, and I try to condense it down to one when I can. I have Exchange (my work email) set up on both phones and I forward calls from the BlackBerry to my personal on weekends. That cuts down on some of the bulk, but it&rsquo;s the exception, not the rule. And for those times when I need to have them both the belt clips are a real necessity.</p>

<p>And besides, it&rsquo;s more comfortable. I often wear dress pants, or loosely fit pants, and in pants like that the iPhone, in particular, tends to sit awkwardly and flap against your leg. It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable and very unsightly. Frankly&mdash;as geeky looking as the belt clip might be&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s far less geeky and far more fashionable to have a relatively unobtrusive phone on your belt than to ruin the fit of your dress clothes.</p>

<p>I guess the bottom line for me is that the belt clip has always been much more about utility than it has been about fashion. I&rsquo;m married. I&rsquo;m not exactly the coolest guy on the block. And I really don&rsquo;t care as much about fashion as I care that I&rsquo;ve got my tools where I need them.</p>

<p>I tend to think about my iPhone like a carpenter thinks about his hammer: I carry it everywhere because I never know when I&rsquo;m going to need it, and when I need it I need it &ldquo;right now.&rdquo; The belt clip serves that purpose in my daily arsenal. Fashion be damned.</p>
