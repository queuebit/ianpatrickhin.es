        Album Review: City and Colour — Live Session (iTunes Exclusive) EP
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/City+and+Colour">City and Colour</a>&nbsp;has very quickly become one of my favorite artists. A stage name for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Dallas+Green">Dallas Green</a>, the lead guitarist and vocalist for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alexisonfire">Alexisonfire</a>, City and Colour is an exceptional example of an artist allowing their inner-self to break out in a side project, only to produce music that is more compelling than that of their &ldquo;better known&rdquo; band.</p>

<p>I first heard City and Colour when I saw him as the opening act for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tegan+and+Sara">Tegan&nbsp;<span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Sara</a>at Rams Head Live! in Baltimore. I was there, like most everyone else, to see Tegan&nbsp;<span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Sara, and was skeptical when I saw that the opening act was just a lone man with a guitar. He walked onto the stage rather awkwardly, wearing a pair of well-worn jeans and a lumberjack-style flannel shirt, and carrying nothing but his guitar; he was, quite possibly, the least presumptuous professional musician I have ever seen.</p>

<p>When he started playing I was immediately impressed, which is saying a lot: I&rsquo;m a very, very jaded concert-goer (not easily impressed). The vocals were spot-on, the music was just the right combination of folk and pop, and there was something about his body-language that just exuded authenticity.</p>

<p>After the concert I went home and immediately downloaded his most recent album,&nbsp;<em>Bring Me Your Love</em>, which, at the time, was the first time I&rsquo;d ever been so impressed by an opening act to buy their album. I&rsquo;ve never looked back since; as of today there are 659 plays of City and Colour logged on my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/ianhines">Last.fm</a>&nbsp;account.</p>

<p>Now, I said this would be a review of the album &ldquo;Live Session (iTunes Exclusive)<span class="caps">EP</span>,&rdquo; and it is. If you want an in-home duplication of the experience I described above&hellip; listen to this live album. As an alternative, check him out on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/transmissions_citycolour">MySpace Transmissions</a>, which includes video. Whatever you do, please: Do yourself a favor and check him out. You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

<p><em>Full-Length tracks available for streaming via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/City+and+Colour">Last.fm</a>.</em></p>
