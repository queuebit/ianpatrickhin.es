  <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was a 2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;lieutenant, and I commanded an infantry platoon of 39 men,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many of your 39 men survived?&rdquo; a reporter asked.</p>
<p>Hoerner&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to write yesterday, but I didn&rsquo;t want to let this weekend go by without some mention of the enormous sacrifice made by the Greatest Generation some 65&nbsp;years (42&nbsp;years before my birth) ago.</p>

<p>I grew up with a strong awareness of military history: my grandfather was a retired enlisted-man who did a tour in Korea and two in Vietnam, my uncle a West Point graduate, and all the trappings of that life surrounded me as a child. My grandfather, in particular, was shaped by the Army. In his house was a study filled with books in military history and strategy, and above the door to that room was my uncle&rsquo;s saber from West Point.</p>

<p>From a very early age I was familiar with the stories of heroism from the Second World War (I have memories of watching George C. Scott as&nbsp;<a title="Patton the Movie on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/">Patton</a>&nbsp;as young as 10-years old), and they shape my ideas of honor, courage, and patriotism at a very fundamental level. So when I heard the following on&nbsp;<span class="caps">NPR</span>&nbsp;last night it brought me nearly to tears:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he had the story of one such veteran: a man named Jim Norene, a member of the 502nd&nbsp;Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st&nbsp;Airborne, who returned to Normandy this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, after visiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep,&rdquo; Obama said. &ldquo;Jim was gravely ill when he left his home, and he knew that he might not return. But just as he did 65&nbsp;years ago, he came anyway. May he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his family always find solace in the heroism he showed here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Norene lived through one of the most horrific battles in human history, survived an additional 65&nbsp;years, and returned on the eve of his death to pay tribute to his brothers in arms. That&rsquo;s truly a story of love and loyalty. He lived through a time when the whole world seemed on the very edge of catastrophe, fought through a battle in which 160,000 Allies engaged 380,000 Germans, resulting in as many as 19,000 casualties total&nbsp;<em>in a single day</em>, and honored the memory of it until his last breath.</p>

<p>Every day there are less people on Earth who remember those days, and to forget them&mdash;not just the facts and figures, but the personal stories&mdash;would truly be a tragedy. So, in the interest of keeping those memories alive I wanted to share Mr. Norene&rsquo;s story; I hope it has a big of an impact on you as it did on me.</p>
