<p>Last month, I wrote a <a href="http://www.ianpatrickhines.com/root_for_the_home_team">blog post</a> about how living in Los Angeles has made me even more of an Orioles fan. And it has. I love my hometown, and I love my hometown team. But I also have a new home, now, and a new home team. I&rsquo;m referring — of course — to the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>

<p>Today, I did something that I would have been unable to imagine a year ago. <em>I bought a Dodgers hat. </em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with the Dodgers since I learned that I would be moving to Los Angeles. It&rsquo;s hard to say what it is, exactly, that&rsquo;s drawn me to them. They are one of the most storied franchises in all of baseball. They&rsquo;re iconic. And what&rsquo;s more, coming from the East Coast I had little pre-conceived bias for or against them. They were just a team — and now they were my local team.</p>

<p>One of the things that struck me when I moved to LA was how often I saw people wearing Dodgers gear. There&rsquo;s clearly a real sense of local pride in the franchise in this town, which is interesting because — prior to moving here — I had never really understood it to be a &ldquo;baseball town.&rdquo; But it is. There&rsquo;re Dodgers fans everywhere.</p>

<p>At times, it feels like the very fabric of the city is woven in Dodger blue: <em>to be part of Los Angeles is to love the Dodgers.</em> And so perhaps it&rsquo;s not surprising that as this city has grown on me, so too has it&rsquo;s team.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve realized that I am actively following the Dodgers remarkable season. I am rooting for them to do well — albeit quietly and alongside the Orioles. (That&rsquo;s one of the beautiful things about baseball: <em>I can simultaneously hope for the Orioles and the Dodgers to play well.</em> They&rsquo;re in different leagues, and their fortunes are not directly intertwined except in rare circumstances.) I&rsquo;m genuinely stoked that the Dodgers will be going to the playoffs. In fact, I&rsquo;m really hoping for a Dodgers vs. Red Sox World Series.</p>

<p>They say that home is where the heart is, and my heart has been moving westward. In my short time here, <em>Los Angeles has been very good to me.</em> It&rsquo;s given me a fresh start, a job that I love, and a wonderful environment to raise my children. Last year, when everything seemed to be falling through, this city was there for me with open arms. And I finally feel ready to embrace it.</p>
