<article class="block">
  <p><a title="The Brooks Review" href="http://brooksreview.net">Ben Brooks</a>&nbsp;appeared on the tech writing scene last April, and has already established himself as one of the go-to websites for competent and insightful commentary.</p>

<p>Ben and I spoke by email between November 19 and December 12, 2010. This is the transcript.</p>

<h2>The Interview</h2>

<p><strong>Ian P. Hines:</strong> Thanks for agreeing to be interviewed. I&rsquo;m an avid reader of your blog, <a href="http://brooksreview.net">The Brooks Review</a> , so it&rsquo;s a real treat for me to be able to do this.</p>

<p>Lets start at the beginning: How long have you kept a weblog, and why did you start in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben Brooks:</strong> I believe my first blog was started when I was a sophomore at university, so sometime between 2002-2003ish is when I first started. None of the blogs I started in college lasted more than a few months, I never had time for them, nor a real desire to do it. I mainly just wanted to see what it was all about back then.</p>
<p>After college I had a few blogs, mostly personal in nature that I kept as more of a journal than anything else. I started The Brooks Review in late April (the 30th to be exact). I started this time around with the intention of just putting my rather raw thoughts about the technology world at large out there for people to read.</p>
<p>The second part to why I started is that I found that I truly love to present, not write necessarily.</p>
<p>I am one of those people who can get up in front of an audience with no prior preparation or notice and just present on stuff &ndash; so long as I have some knowledge on the subject. Since it is not practical to run around giving talks, I turned to blogging. I have found that I really enjoy writing, and the more I write the more I want to write. With the added bonus of my Wife not being subjected to all of my thoughts about why some obscure new device sucks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Sounds like we&rsquo;re of the same mold. I started dabbling in blogging around 2003, but it never really stuck for me either. And I&rsquo;m the same way with presenting&mdash;but I&rsquo;m lucky enough to get paid to do it offline.</p>

<p>So what was so special about this past April? Has The Brooks Review been a long time coming, or was it more of a <a href="http://Benrhone.com/2009/08/05/the-24-hour-idea/">24-hour idea</a> like <a href="http://minimalmac.com">Minimal Mac</a> ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Hmm it was an idea that was concocted late March on my Wife and I&rsquo;s flight to Hawaii for our honeymoon &ndash; she was asleep next to me and had just left her job. She knew that she wanted to work form home, but really had no ideas of what to do. My wife is a great writer, but hates to share her work I have been trying to encourage her for months to start blogging as an outlet for her frustrating (terrible really) employment situation.</p>
<p>I pulled out a mini Moleskin that I had in my bag and started to just jot down ideas of anything that I could possible help her start. Turns out I diverged and came up with The Brooks Review instead. Since I am a big believe that ideas mean nothing until they are executed, here are the snap shots of the pages from that Moleskin that launched the idea for The Brooks Review.</p>
<p>This is the page, the blue writing is where I stopped &ndash; with Approveddevices.com and Tech Reviews. My idea was to create a site where I &ldquo;approved&rdquo; of stuff, sort of like putting my stamp of approval on things. That felt way too limiting and I hated the name so I ended up with The Brooks Review after looking at <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/">MIT&rsquo;s Technology Review</a> and <a href="http://hbr.org/">Harvard&rsquo;s Business Review</a> and liking the integrity and depth that they both achieve. (The writing in what looks like a terrible Bic pen is my test of the Sharpie Liquid pencil &ndash; definitely not a good writing tool.)</p>
<p>( <a title="Ben's Journal" href="http://brooksreview.net/imgs/start2.jpg">Click Here</a> to view Ben&rsquo;s journal.)</p>
<p>Many people are confused by the name thinking that the site is only about reviewing products &ndash; while I like doing that &ndash; I use a different definition of review. I use &lsquo;review&rsquo; in the sense that it is my assessment of things currently going on. Which is rather vague on purpose.</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten about this until you asked the questions and I was very glad I still had the notebook. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> It&rsquo;s interesting that your inspiration came primarily from print publications, as your site bears little overt resemblance to a print publication. I always compare TBR in my mind to Daring Fireball, actually, though with a different style.</p>

<p>John Gruber famously said that when he writes for Daring Fireball he tries to write content of the quality he&rsquo;d expect to find in The New Yorker. I&rsquo;m curious: what&rsquo;s your yardstick for success? When you start writing original content, who is your ideal reader and how do they feel about it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> It would be untrue to say that Daring Fireball didn&rsquo;t play a role in the site, it certainly does. I have always liked reading Gruber&rsquo;s comments on links and really wanted to do that on TBR. I think the difference in the style that you feel has to do with the expertise that I hold versus that which Gruber holds. He is clearly a person that understands programming and has an excellent understanding of the technical aspects. I, on the other hand, am a business major and my computing knowledge is 100% self taught (with little programming knowledge), so I tend to steer the conversation more towards trends, marketing, strategy and practical uses. At least that is what I shoot for, the readers are the real judges of what I talk about.</p>
<p>I guess the way I judge my success is by how much discussion I generate around a topic. I love reading tweets, other blogs, and emails from readers who had something to say about what I wrote. I honestly am not concerned with people agreeing with me, the discussion is what I love. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many people still email me asking about MacBook Air usage and so on &ndash; what a great way to connect with others. Aside from that I don&rsquo;t know how else I would judge success.</p>
<p>My writing is aimed at me, I used to try to write to a particular type of person, but readers can always see through that kind of writing. I try to write things that I would like to read. I subscribe to my own RSS feed so that I can make sure things are working but I always amuse myself when I stop on my own headline and almost hit the &lsquo;send to instapaper&rsquo; button before I realize that I wrote the thing. That is not to toot my own horn, I just think to myself that I succeeded in writing to myself. Makes me chuckle every time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Alright, so now I&rsquo;m curious: what is in your Instapaper right now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Surprisingly not much right now, I typically get it zeroed each day before I go to bed. I only have the stock read later folder and a &lsquo;to watch&rsquo; folder. The &lsquo;to watch&rsquo; folder is brimming with videos that I want to watch, but I have a tough time finding time to watch these things. One thing that has been in Instapaper for a while is the <a href="http://www.playboy.co.uk/print/print-article/item77251/">Playboy interview</a> with Steve Jobs from 1985 &ndash; I have only gotten part of the way through it, it is so long I have yet to finish it.</p>
<p>The rest is just stuff from Twitter or Instapaper and various other places that I want to check out. Everything goes to Instapaper first then I move through it, it is my catch all for things that sound interesting.</p>
<p>I also subscribe the &lsquo;Editor&rsquo;s Picks&rsquo; which shows up as another folder, as well as Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s, Marco Arment&rsquo;s and John Gruber&rsquo;s starred items so I can see if I missed anything great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> And all around the Internet people with overflowing Instapaper accounts I&rsquo;ll their eyes in jealousy and procrastinators guilt.</p>

<p>You said everything goes through Instapaper&mdash;do you read it in-app? Or do you follow it back to the original website and read in context?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> It depends on where I am, during working hours I use Instapaper on my computer so everything is read on the website it originated. The only exception to that is when I find the website ugly, in which case I use the Instapaper text view. On mobile it is always in-app which is my preferred method, but it&rsquo;s just not that convenient when I am already in a Mac.</p>
<p>Marco Arment has done just a fantastic job with Instapaper. I love adding links from Twitter because it maintains a via attribute for me. That is when I add a link from Twitter on my phone it shows the tweet and who tweeted it so that later I can refer back to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> So it&rsquo;s really contextual for you? Easier to read plain text on the iPhone, but more enjoyable to read the full site on the Mac when you know it will render properly?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious how you&rsquo;re making use of the &ldquo;View&rdquo; (V shortcut) and Instapaper Mobilizer features in Reeder for Mac. Have they changed the flow of your reading at all? Or is it too early to tell?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> It really is too early to tell you Reeder, I have been using it for like a day and a half at this point. So far I am using Reeder about the same as I did NetNewsWire &ndash; that is reading the headlines and sending articles to Instapaper. The only time I really stop and read something in the RSS reader is if it is really compelling, or breaking news type stuff.</p>
<p>I have testes that View shortcut and I must say I like having that ability, I think once Reeder (hopefully) becomes more keyboard friendly I may just do more and more reading in that it. For now Reeder has only changed my happiness level when reading RSS feeds, not the way I read things, yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Shifting gears back to The Brooks Review, can you share a bit about how you write? Where do you do it? What&rsquo;s your flow like? Paint me a picture&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> My writing process would lead you to believe that I have some sort of ADD (no offense to those that do) &ndash; I am all over the place when I write. I use two main programs: Ulysses and TextMate. I would say that 90% of the time Ulysses is used for everything. The other 10% is in TextMate or Writer on the iPad. Typically I only use TextMate when I need to compose something quickly, as in I will not be coming back to the post later.</p>
<p>The single most important aspect of my entire writing process is reading and conversations. That is where 100% of my ideas come from, I read something or am talking to someone about something that spurs a completely separate thought in my head. I read a ton of stuff every day and when I get the chance I try to engage others about any topic, all of that gets my mind going and usually results in some interesting ideas that I want to explore.</p>
<p>As with everything my posts start with an idea, if I am at my computer when I get that idea then I just create a new document in Ulysses with a general title and jot a few notes. If I am on the go I do the same in OmniFocus and then open a new document later when I am back at my computer. Lately I am not lacking in ideas, just time to write them all up. I tend to bounce between the posts and just work on the ones that I find most interesting at the time.</p>
<p>Typically I will close post ideas that I just don&rsquo;t like, leaving them for another time, or to be forgotten all together. I don&rsquo;t outline many posts as that just seems like a waste of time to me, though I do try to outline reviews so I don&rsquo;t miss anything. From there I just write and write with only a concept of what I want to say in mind.</p>
<p>If I am really busy during the day and don&rsquo;t get a chance to write I compose the post aloud in my car. I don&rsquo;t record my thoughts, but I try to get my ideas worked out so that when I get back to my computer I can jot down a few notes that will remind me of my internal conversation on the topic. I try to think about posts while I am driving as if I am explaining it in an interview, asking questions about how and why I think a certain way, this helps (hopefully) to give me a clear insight about the post.</p>
<p>Once I am done I read through the post a couple of times, the first time I am looking to see how it flows and to add or remove content where needed. I have a terrible tendency of glossing over things that I understand but that others may not get, especially just concluding something without enough explanation as to why and how I concluded that. The second read through is looking for typos and confusing/crappy sentences, at this point I try not to add things, only to subtract them if needed.</p>
<p>All of this writing tends to take place whenever I can get the time. I usually write at work when I have free time (which is often) or while my wife watches a TV show that I don&rsquo;t care for at night. I rarely ever write in the early morning as I am trying to catch up on what happened from the night before and while I was asleep. My favorite times to write are on the weekend mornings after I have &lsquo;caught up&rsquo; but while my wife still sleeps or on Fridays when I work from home. It is quiet and nice to just pop Ulysses into fullscreen on my Air and write.</p>
<p>The biggest struggle I have is trying to decide whether I should write or read at any given point in time. I have yet to figure out how to solve that problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Well, you clearly spend a lot of time reading and writing (judging by the pace and quality of your posts). How does your wife feel about the time commitment? Meaning, how do find balance between the online and the offline?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Up and until this week my wife was working from home, trying to get her business off the ground, last week she was offered and amazing position doing something she loved, it is a full time job outside of our home. Now that she is gone most of the day she needs a few hours each night to work on her own business and I take advantage of that time to work on TBR. Before she worked full time it was real struggle and usually I would just work for a couple of hours (in 10 minute here an there chunks) each night on TBR and that was it, most of that time was spent editing and keeping up on RSS feeds.</p>
<p>Most of the writing and reading I do during the day, while I am at work. Luckily it is my own company and I have been very slow (it is a real estate company and we all know how that market is fairing) so I have an abundance of time to work on my own projects during the day.</p>
<p>I try to stay very conscious of how much time I am spending working on TBR while I am at home. My wife understands when I have something that I really need to do, but other than that I try to only work when she is busy doing something else. On the weekends I usually am able to work for a couple of hours before she wakes up (I am an early riser) and then I don&rsquo;t do much else the rest of the weekend.</p>
<p>I am very fortunate though that she understands how much I enjoy writing and reading about technology and thus far she has been very supportive of my efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Sounds like you have your priorities properly in order. I know that the wife/web balance is something I truly struggle with as well, and I suspect we&rsquo;re not alone.</p>

<p>Shifting gears back to content, what&rsquo;s the favorite gadget you&rsquo;ve ever reviewed?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> My favorite gadget to date is the iPad, but I didn&rsquo;t do a proper review for it. I felt that others did a sufficient job at reviewing it so I started talking about how one uses the iPad in normal life. I think though the review I am most proud of is my MacBook Air review, I really like how it turned out. The review that I had the most fun doing was the Samsung Galaxy Tab review because I didn&rsquo;t have to pay for the device for a change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I enjoyed that one, as well. You nearly convinced me to buy an Air for my next machine (not that I needed much convincing).</p>

<p>What about when you want to read a review? Where do you go for advice when you&rsquo;re considering a new product or service?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> I go to the normal places that most go Pogue, Mossberg, Ars, AnandTech, TUAW, Engadget and others. I usually never find one review that covers all aspects that I want to know about, I doubt anybody ever finds everything they want in a single review. I only start to get frustrated after I can&rsquo;t find a single review that has something I want to know about, much like <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/11/4-suck/">I found</a> with the Samsung Galaxy Tab and the lack of information about typing on the device.</p>
<p>I rarely ever take just one review as the single definitive word on the matter and I would urge others not to as well. I tend to look for competing reviews, so if I read 3 reviews that love the product I really try to seek out one that hates it. I love to get different perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> So is that normally what gets you wont to review a device yourself? When you can&rsquo;t find a review that answers your questions?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> That is what gets me to review devices like the Samsung Galaxy Tab which is something that I would have never considered buying for myself. The rest of the reviews are of products that I buy and I really want to share with others my thoughts on the device and whether it is worth their money. I hope the build some better relationships so I can get a few devices here and there every year that I don&rsquo;t buy &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t want to be reviewing something all the time because it really has a negative impact on my productivity.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Tab forced me to change my entire workflow and carry and extra gadget along. It was fin to do, but not something I want to do more than a few times a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> One of the things you and I have talked about in the past is advertising on the web. You don&rsquo;t have any ads on The Brooks Review, though you do offer sponsorships.</p>

<p>What do you think about advertising on the web&ndash;both on blogs and larger publications?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Advertising is such a hot button topic for many people, that certainly includes me. I think 99% of all larger publications do advertising wrong. If you have a splash page or an ad that pops up over your content, you are doing it wrong. In fact if you have any kind of advertising that: moves, blinks, makes noise, plays a video, then I think you are doing it horribly wrong.</p>
<p>I understand the need for advertising and when done correctly it can not only be effective in making everyone money, but it can also be a value add for the reader. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I clicked on a banner ad that was trying to shoot the monkey, or anything else. I can tell you that I often click on the well done ads by Fusion and The Deck. These type of ad networks with unobtrusive, highly targeted, highly curated ads are something that never bug me and usually ad some value to the experience. That is not to say that everything being advertised is new to me, but there are a few times when I find a new product. Most often though I am reminded about a product that I used in the past and then I want to look to see what has changed since I last used it.</p>
<p>Advertising is so tough, hosting a blog that has even moderate traffic gets expensive to do, especially when you are paying for good hosting and quality backup solutions. Add to that the time you spend writing and editing and you can begin to see why people want/need ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> And of course therein lies the problem: aside from The Deck, Fusion, and Carbon where is a writer to turn? Sponsorships? Not every blog can sustain that reliably. Amazon stores? Seems unreliable. You&rsquo;re a smart guy&hellip; What do you see as the solution?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have the solution that you seek. What I can say though is that there isn&rsquo;t just one solution to rule them all. I think RSS feed sponsorships are a great idea if done weekly and one single writer websites. When you get to multi-writer sites trying to do that it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right any longer.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program, as well as the one Media Temple has in place is actually pretty decent. You won&rsquo;t get rich off of them, but they are an easy, unobtrusive way to &ldquo;pay the bills&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But you are right most of these solutions are rather unreliable, since day one I have had RSS feed sponsorships up and ready to go on my site, I have yet to sell a single one. Though to be fair my site is still very new (less than a year old) and all I have done to advertise that I have those sponsorships available is to have a link in the sites navigation.</p>
<p>That though really doesn&rsquo;t bug me, I didn&rsquo;t start a blog so I could be a salesman trying to get people to give me money. That is something I never want to do, and if that means I don&rsquo;t make as much money, or any money, then I truly am fine with that.</p>
<p>Networks like The Deck, Fusion, and Carbon are rather difficult to get into and at this point who knows if they really can afford to keep taking on more publishers. So it certainly is tough for people that don&rsquo;t want to sell the ad space themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Well, I don&rsquo;t think most folks seek out ads to make money. It&rsquo;s like that Walt Disney quote John Gruber likes so much: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t make movies to make money, we make money so that we can make more movies.&rdquo; Most people are, like you said, looking to ads to cover hosting an other costs so that they can keep writing.</p>

<p>Now, The Brooks Review is your primary site. Do you have others? Do you ever feel confined by TBR&rsquo;s focus?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> That Disney quote is a great one. I have a couple of other sites, <a href="http://www.b3nbrooks.com">a personal blog</a> which I host on tumblr of all places. I mainly do the cool Tumblr blogger thing and post pictures and quotes on that site that don&rsquo;t really fit on TBR. I also have a <a href="http://www.benbrooks.me">profile page</a> that I made when I left Facebook. It was just an easy way to give family and friends an easy to remember URL that they could use to &ldquo;check in&rdquo; on me.</p>
<p>With TBR I think I would have felt pretty confined by now if I had tried to brand it as a Mac blog or a Gadget blog or anything else more specific than just technology. If you stop and think about it though, the seemingly &ldquo;off topic&rdquo; things I post, like WikiLeaks&rsquo; politic bouts, or TSA&rsquo;s stupidity &ndash; all of that stuff is centered around technology. That is kind of a sneaky thing, just about everything we do these days revolves around technology. I could probably talk about photography and cars (two of my other passions) without going too far off topic that I alienate my readers.</p>
<p>So far I have yet to feel anything but confined which if you could see some of the posts I am working on, you would get a clear idea that maybe I need to be a little more confined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Well hopefully those sites will see a bit more traffic after this interview is published.</p>

<p>Last question: If you could give any one piece of advice to aspiring online writers (because you can!), what would it be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben:</strong> &lsquo;10 writing tools to improve your writing&rsquo;, &lsquo;15 tips to help you become a better writer&rsquo;, &lsquo;50 ways to become an excellent writer&rsquo;, &lsquo;10 tips to drive more traffic to your blog&rsquo;, &lsquo;this is the best writing tool&rsquo; &ndash; anything like that is as toxic for you as credit card debt. Just write and write a lot. Write about things that interest you, write things that you would like to read. I like to believe that with practice your writing begins to blossom. Don&rsquo;t focus on web stats (hardest thing in the world not to do), and don&rsquo;t pay attention to what others are telling you unless it is constructive.</p>
