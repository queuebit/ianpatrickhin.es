        SMART Goals

<article class="block">
  <p>When I graduated college, I embarked on a career as a public school teacher in my home city of Baltimore. Full of enthusiasm, but having no background in education, I matriculated into the <a href="http://www.bcteachingresidency.org/">Baltimore City Teaching Residency</a> program.</p>

<p><span class="caps">BCTR</span>, which is essentially a subsidiary of&nbsp;<a href="http://tntp.org/">The New Teacher Project</a>, recruits, trains, and supports non-traditional teacher candidates in order to provide inner-city schools with effective teachers. Though I ultimately left the teaching profession, the experiences I had during my time in the program changed my life forever. The most significant of these was my introduction to the idea of&nbsp;<span class="caps">SMART</span>&nbsp;Goals.</p>

<h2><span class="caps">What Are </span><span class="caps">SMART</span><span class="caps"> Goals?</span></h2>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">Wikipedia</a>, <span class="caps">SMART</span> is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=define:mneumonic&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">mnemonic</a> used to describe a set of criteria by which an individual or group can assess the goals or objectives for a project. That&rsquo;s certainly accurate. But to me, <span class="caps">SMART</span> is much more like <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done"><span class="caps">GTD</span></a>, i.e., an idea that is, quite simply, life changing.</p>

<p>The entire concept grows out of <em>the idea that the entire purpose for having a goal is to achieve it</em>. Seems simple enough. But all too often our goals are ambiguous, or as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)">David Allen</a> would say, &ldquo;not actionable.&rdquo; We all have these sorts of &ldquo;squishy&rdquo; goals in our lives (ex: &ldquo;prepare the house to go on the market&rdquo;). They sound nice, but what does success look like? Certainly different than the status quo, but aside from that it&rsquo;s really hard to say.</p>

<p><em>The idea behind <span class="caps">SMART</span> goals is to rethink these &ldquo;squishy&rdquo; goals to make them into something achievable, measurable, and valuable.</em> As I mentioned, <span class="caps">SMART</span> is a mneumonic, or learning tool, designed to help you remember the following attributes that should be applicable to each and every goal you set:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Specific</strong>: Goals should be articulated as narrowly as possible, to facilitate easier visualization of the desired outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Measurable</strong>: Each goal must contain certain criteria by which success or failure can be measured concretely.</li>
<li><strong>Actionable</strong>: Focus on things that you can do. Now. With the skills and resources you have at your disposal. Doing anything else will simply result in frustration and resignation.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic</strong>: If your goals are too ambitious, your mind will subconsciously concede defeat before you even begin. Set your sights high, but keep your target within reach.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Bound</strong>: Set a deadline for completion. Without a hard deadline, procrastination will become your undoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Use <span class="caps">SMART</span> Goals?</h2>

<p>These seem like common sense principles, but my experience has shown me that they are rarely implemented in either the personal or professional world. If they were, a great number of our seemingly &ldquo;intractable&rdquo; problems would be resolved rather a great deal more swiftly than we&rsquo;d imagined possible.</p>

<p>To refer to a previous example, a squishy goal like &ldquo;prepare the house to go on the market&rdquo; is so broad that is is practically un-achievable. How will you know whether the house is ready? Without specific criteria, you&rsquo;ll never know for certain and will therefore be continually stressed. That&rsquo;s what makes <span class="caps">SMART</span> goals so great: unlike squishy goals they&rsquo;re designed to be completed, not fretted over.</p>

<h2>Turning Squishy Goals into <span class="caps">SMART</span> Goals</h2>

<p>To turn a squishy goal into a <span class="caps">SMART</span> goal requires three basic steps: (1) visualize success, (2) define what it looks like, and (3) set a deadline.</p>

<p>For example, a typical squishy goal might sound something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get the house ready to go on the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like something you&rsquo;ve had on a to-do list recently? I thought so. This is the sort of goal that comes up in conversation&mdash;say, in the car on the way to the store. It&rsquo;s a start, in that it describes what you want, but it&rsquo;s ultimately junk because it doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything about what being &ldquo;ready to go on the market&rdquo; looks like.</p>

<p>However, visualize success (i.e., house is ready to go on the market), define what it looks like (i.e., a fresh coat of paint has been added and clutter has been removed), and set a deadline (say, the first day of Spring) and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a <span class="caps">SMART</span> goal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the first day of Spring we will have decluttered and painted the house a bright, neutral color so that we can put the house on the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the original goal, this <span class="caps">SMART</span> goal is actionable. Decluttering and painting are things that you can do. Moreover, they are things that you can meaure by your deadline: &ldquo;Have they been done, or not? Lets check.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>In Short</h2>

<p>Using <span class="caps">SMART</span> goals will allow you to convert those seemingly intractable goals you&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;meaning to get to&rdquo; into concrete, actionable projects you can handle. Even if you&rsquo;re not a <span class="caps">GTD</span> devotee, this simple shift in approach will increase your productivity (and the quality of your results) dramatically.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, <span class="caps">SMART</span> goals aren&rsquo;t complicated at all. In fact they&rsquo;re quite formulaic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By (date / deadline) we will (measurable goal / definition of success) so that (desired outcome).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, all it takes is three basic steps: (1) visualize success, (2) define what it looks like, and (3) set a deadline.</p>
