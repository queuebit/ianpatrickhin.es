  <p><em>An open letter to the Republican candidates for President of the United States of America.</em></p>

<p>Dear Candidates —</p>

<p>My name is Ian Patrick Hines. I am a Republican, a Marylander, and a proud American citizen. I am writing today to express my grave concern for the future of our republic, and to plead with you to take action to prevent the unthinkable.</p>

<p>Each week, Donald Trump’s campaign seems to take another dark turn. What began as an almost comical exercise by an overgrown adolescent has—in the past few weeks—come to look more and more like the early days of a rising fascist dictatorship. His penchant for telling outright lies, attacking—as fundamentally corrupt—foundational American institutions like the free press, and demonizing immigrants, Muslims, and anyone who disagrees with him threatens to undercut the very fabric of our republic. He must be stopped. Immediately.</p>

<p>I know that over the Summer, many of you attempted ignoring him in the hopes that he would implode—falling victim to his own flaws. He has not. Then, some of you attempted to shame him into conformity with established norms for civilized political discourse. He responded by becoming ever-more extreme, and your poll numbers faded. As a result, the field collectively has seemed to adopt a “wait-and-see” posture in the hopes that either (a) he will fade down the stretch or (b) you’ll be able to use the media’s requests for comment on his statements into an opportunity to communicate your message—riding the wave of his coverage, as it were. It will not work, and he in the meantime he is growing stronger and more bold.</p>

<p><strong>While the field remains fractured into more than a dozen candidacies, none of you will be strong enough to take him on alone.</strong></p>

<p>I know you all want to become president. I understand that, and each of you bring unique talents, experiences, and perspectives to the table. I would have loved a primary election cycle where we had the opportunity to debate your varying leadership styles and visions for the future of our country, but that is not election in which we find ourselves. Instead, have been besieged by cancer of racism, nativism, and (potentially) fascism the likes of which our era of American politics has never experienced. And if we do not take the threat seriously now, our window of opportunity will soon close.</p>

<p>I fear that if Donald Trump wins the Iowa Caucuses in February, his campaign will be unstoppable. Given his existing position in national polls, and the momentum he’ll carry with him out of Iowa, I cannot foresee how any of your campaigns counters him after Iowa. You must move to stop this menace now.</p>

<p>That is why I am writing you today: to plead with you to take this threat seriously, and consider honestly whether your continued campaigning is helping solve or continuing to fuel this situation. I believe that in order to stop him, we must narrow the field dramatically—now. We must present the nation with a clear choice in the upcoming primaries and caucuses between genuine American Conservatism and Trump’s nativist populism. To do that, the dynamic of the race need to shift from “everyone vs. Trump” to “Trump vs. [Candidate].”</p>

<p><strong>To be clear: I am asking most of you to withdraw from the race. Only one candidate can win the nomination. Right now, it looks likely to be Trump, and unlikely to be you. For the greater good, that cannot come to pass.</strong></p>

<p>Trump is currently leading the field with a plurality of votes—but not a majority. We can still stem the tide and stop him from gaining the authority to implement his proposals, but only if we work together.</p>

<p>Trump is a wolf in sheep’s clothing: He is not a Republican—not really—and his influence in this race threatens to undermine the very fabric of our republic. If you truly want what’s best for the nation, selflessly do what you can to stop Donald Trump from becoming the Republican nominee and—God forbid—the President of the United States.</p>

<p>—Ian</p>
