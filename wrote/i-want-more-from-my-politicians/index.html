        I Want More From My Politicians
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>I want more from my politicians. And before you roll your eyes, no, this isn&rsquo;t a cynical rant about the nature of politics or anything like that. On the contrary: I love politics, and I love politicians (as odd as that may sound). That&rsquo;s just it: I want more.</p>

<p>I want more authenticity, more access, more openness, more&hellip; real-ness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted by those politicians who refuse to interact with the public like real, normal people. Because lets be honest, behind all the pomp &amp; circumstance that&rsquo;s exactly what they are: real, normal people. It&rsquo;s about time they started acting like it.</p>

<p>We have tools today that make it possible for politicians to convey their innate humanity to their constituents in an unprecedented way. Sharing thoughts, ideas, questions, or concerns on the fly has never been easier, thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Photographs from public appearances are easily uploaded to&nbsp;<a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>&nbsp;in near-real time. Speaking of events,&nbsp;<a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>&nbsp;makes it possible to constant (and selectively) update constituents with your current location and activity (talk about transparency &amp; accountability!). Never before in human history has it been so easy to let the world get to know you. Not the marketed, made for T.V. you: the real you. And I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most politicians disagree. A recent University of Maryland&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/19/AR2009091902389.html?wprss=rss_politics">study</a>&nbsp;found that out of 6,000 tweets by members of Congress, most were &ldquo;boastful or boring.&rdquo; Though, certainly, there is some room for interviewer bias there (Who says the folks doing the study were Twitter fans?), I can&rsquo;t help but assume that this serves as evidence for my suspicion: politicians are using Twitter, but they don&rsquo;t get Twitter.</p>

<p>This is partly because Twitter, at its best, is the anti-politics: it&rsquo;s real, organic, spontaneous, and open. The most authentic, interesting people on Twitter aren&rsquo;t the ones who are constantly selling you a pre-packaged version of themselves. The most interesting people on Twitter are the ones being themselves. This, understandably, makes politicians uncomfortable&mdash;and maybe it should. Politics, after all, is perception; if you let your guard down you yield control.</p>

<p>But I guess this is my point: I think that&rsquo;s a good thing. If you think about it the root of most political scandals is that people suddenly realize that their public officials weren&rsquo;t who they were pretending to be. They aren&rsquo;t necessarily angry about whatever the indiscretion was&mdash;most people have moved on from Bill Clinton, for example&mdash;they&rsquo;re angry that they were lied to. People want authenticity &amp; honesty from their politicians; they do not want to be fed prepared remarks or read tweets with&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley/status/8432115368">embarrassing spelling</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a politician and you&rsquo;re reading this, I hope you leave with a few clear thoughts. First, thank you for serving: you have my utmost respect and admiration, as it&rsquo;s a pretty thankless job (despite popular perception). Second, be yourself online. The last thing anyone wants is to subscribe to &ldquo;your&rdquo; Twitter feed only to discover that it&rsquo;s really some staffer or intern. It only makes you look bad.</p>
