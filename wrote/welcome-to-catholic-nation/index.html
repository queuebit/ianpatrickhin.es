<article class="block">
  <p>Hello. My name is Ian, and I’d like to welcome you to Catholic Nation.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that if I want this site to have any credibility, I ought to share my own story: who I am, how I came to the Church and why I’m undertaking this project.</p>

<p>I grew up in a culturally Catholic — but genuinely non-religious — household. Both of my parents were raised Catholic, and both had left the Church. But I was surrounded by the trappings of High Church Christianity and Traditionalism (books by J.R.R. Tolkein, Madeleine L’Engle and C.S. Lewis defined my childhood, for example), and my parents sense of moral certitude (‘A Hines does not lie, cheat or steal… nor tolerate those who do.’) left me quite confident that there was a knowable moral order in the world.</p>

<p>This was all true as recently as 2008–09, when I was a non-believer who — despite my best efforts — was being drawn towards God and the Church. Visits to the great catedrals of Europe had sparked something within me, and the more questions I asked the more questions I had. But I soon found that the answers were hard to find, and my frustration grew.</p>

<p>As it turns out, if you’re curious about the faith there are a number of great books you can read. (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catholic-Way-Faith-Living-Today/dp/038550182X">The Catholic Way</a> by Cardinal Donald Weurl of Washington, by the way.) But if you’re looking for answers — or community — online, you’d better enjoy sifting through a world of garbage.</p>

<p>Most of my questions were answered during the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA), which I suspect is the case for most Catholic converts. But it was the getting to RCIA that — in my case — was the hardest part. And I can’t help but wonder how many people like me give up along the way because the answers they’re looking for can’t be easily found online.</p>

<p>My goal with Catholic Nation is twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li>To build the site I wish I could have found when I was discerning my own call to the faith, so that it can be a beacon of light for others still lost in the dark; and</li>
<li>To create a platform for teaching best practices for digital organizing and communications, so that the countless parishes around the country with — frankly — terrible websites can begin to learn to do better online.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that there are tons of people out there who’ve had experiences like me. Together, we can fill this site with the benefit of our collective experience and help leverage the internet’s limitless ability to connect people to grow the Church we love so much.</p>
