<article class="block">
  <p>My four year old son has recently discovered LEGO and — as is the case with most children his age — he is in love with them. In our basement, we have converted a “train table” into a “LEGO table.” He asks us for the kits — the pre-designed sets — but he never fails to dissemble them and build his own creations. He loves to imagine, create, destroy, and begin anew.</p>

<p>As a child, I was never much for LEGO. They were okay, but they do not hold a prominent place in my childhood memories. But as a parent, I adore them. They are so simple — elegant even — and with them you can create whole universes. In that way, they remind me of HTML &amp; CSS.</p>

<p>HTML &amp; CSS are the bricks with which we build the web. Anyone can look under the hood of your website and see how it works — and they often do. That is how I learned to make websites: I “borrowed” code, line by line, from my favorite websites until I learned how to do it myself. In fact, it is still how most of us in the web design community learn today.</p>

<p>Like our children with their LEGO sets, we use popular frameworks to teach us new tricks and spark our imaginations. We peek at each other’s code, asking “how did she make that button?” or “how does that work?”. We take each other’s work apart to learn how it works, and apply that knowledge to our next project.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://zurb.com">leaders</a> <a href="http://alistapart.com">of</a> <a href="http://csstricks.com">our</a> <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">community</a> are the ones who are <a href="http://github.com">most open</a> about their work, not the most private. They build up the community by empowering others to create, themselves. And in so doing, they’ve grown the community — and we’re all better for it.</p>

<p>I’ve heard it said that the first few dozen members of any community define its culture, whether they know it or not. The <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/?recruiter_id=219736">NationBuilder</a> community is still young. If we are ever to achieve success of the WordPress, Shopify, or Tumblr communities, we must embrace a culture of openness. When you learn a new trick, share it. Build a new theme framework? Open source it. We’ll move the ball forward on NationBuilder adoption and innovation faster than we ever could alone.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of leading by example, I am <a href="http://github.com/ianpatrickhines">open sourcing</a> each of my non-client NationBuilder themes — five in total. Later this year, I hope to release two more: developer frameworks based upon <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation 5</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap 3</a>. Like my son’s LEGO sets, I hope that these will inspire you and set you on your way to building your own creations.</p>

<p>You can find them on Github at <a href="http://github.com/ianpatrickhines">github.com/ianpatrickhines</a>.</p>
