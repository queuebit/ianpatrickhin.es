        From Gmail to Google Apps

<article class="block">
  <p>When Gmail first hit the scene back in 2004, I was among its earliest adopters. A full time volunteer for Howard Dean at the time, I had known a number of folks who had initial beta invites and managed to snag one. So it was that ianhines {@} gmail.com became my first &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; email address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be entirely truthful, I can&rsquo;t even remember any of the addresses I had prior to my first Gmail because they were that un-memorable. Gmail&rsquo;s launch was timed perfectly for me: I was 18-years old, about to graduate high school, and just beginning to have a real interest in projecting a mature, professional face to the world. Gone were the days of&nbsp;<a title="This was never a real username. But you get the idea.">&lsquo;LacrosseGuy1234&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;type usernames. I was going to college, and I wanted my email address to reflect it.</p>

<p>The Gmail solution served me well for years. I currently have more than 30,000 emails archived, and have yet to reach 20% of my account&rsquo;s memory limit. Gmail&rsquo;s Spam-Blocking, Search, and Conversation Threading&nbsp;<a title="Link to Gmail.com" href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/about.html">features</a>&nbsp;make storing and retrieving emails nearly effortless. In fact, Google is so good at storing and retrieving messages that during my college years I took to using my inbox as a flash drive, storing my important documents in my inbox instead of on my hard drive.</p>

<p>It is, quite nearly, the perfect email solution. Nearly.</p>

<h2>The Permanency Concern</h2>

<p>Facebook&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a title="Link to NYTimes.com" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/technology/internet/17facebook.html">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;scandal was a real wake up call for me. I suddenly realized that the web-services I used on a daily basis could up and change at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<p>What if Gmail suddenly asserted proprietary control over the contents of all of my emails? I would cancel my service, that&rsquo;s what. But then I would lose control over the only email address I use. Suddenly hundreds of friends, family, and professional contacts wouldn&rsquo;t know how to reach me; tens of thousands of archived emails would be lost.</p>

<p>This potential chain of events was most definitely unacceptable. There had to be a way to preserve the Gmail service I know and love without relying on an email address that I, ultimately, did not control. Then it hit me: I needed to host my own email. Sure, it wouldn&rsquo;t be free (like Gmail had been for years), but I would have the security of knowing that the address was permanent.</p>

<h2>ian {@} ianhines.com&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Google Apps</h2>

<p>I began hosting my own email about two weeks ago here on ianhines.com, and I immediately remembered why I have long hated traditional Web Mail. The interface was awkward, the folder structure rigid, and worst of all&mdash;no search integration. After nearly five years of Gmail there was no turning back, so like any good Gmail loyalist I installed&nbsp;<a title="Google Apps Standard Edition" href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps</a>&nbsp;on my server.</p>

<p>The installation went smoothly (though not quickly, but that&rsquo;s another entry all together), and pretty soon ian {at} ianhines.com was up and running with full Gmail functionality. Now I had the best of both worlds: a static, proprietary email address and the Gmail interface. I immediately went to work ensuring that all my various Gmail accounts forwarded to my new address (I have more than one), as I don&rsquo;t have to tell you what an annoyance it can be to have to check multiple email accounts (even with&nbsp;<a title="Easily the best way to integrate Gmail with your OS X experience" href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">MailPlane.app</a>). I must say I was quite pleased with myself, and went to bed that night quite satisfied.</p>

<p>But, as I&rsquo;m sure many of you were already thinking, it was too good to be true. The next morning it hit me: forwarding or not, all of my 30,000+ emails are stored on an account that I won&rsquo;t be logging into anymore, undercutting the very purpose of having the Gmail interface. Gmail&rsquo;s has a built in solution to this problem, which essentially &lsquo;links&rsquo; two account via&nbsp;POP3&nbsp;and thereby downloads your messages to the new server, but this solution wouldn&rsquo;t work for me. There were simply too many messages (30,000+, or ~ 1&nbsp;GB) spread over too many Labels for it to work effectively or in any reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>I needed another solution, and what I found was&nbsp;<a title="YippieMove: Email Transfer Made Easy" href="https://www.yippiemove.com/">YippieMove</a>.</p>

<p>On Thursday, 05/07/09, I&rsquo;ll be posting a step-by-step review of my mass email transfer via YippieMove (with screenshots).</p>
