<article class="block">
  <p><a title="Chris Bowler" href="http://chrisbowler.com">Chris Bowler</a> creates things. Quietly. You&rsquo;ve seen his work&mdash; <a href="http://fusionads.net">Fusion Ads</a> &mdash;though you probably didn&rsquo;t know it was his. Chris is like that: he focuses on quality, not credit. Chris is one of those few people who quietly bind the web community together.</p>

<h3>The Interview</h3>

<p>This interview was conducted via email and <a href="http://writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a> between August 24, 2010 and last Sunday. We try not to rush these things.</p>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> First of all, thank you for agreeing to be interviewed.</p>

<p>I always find it best to start at the beginning, so here goes: How did you get started in online publishing? What got you into it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris Bowler:</strong> I&rsquo;ve mentioned it elsewhere, but it started back when my daughter (our first) was born. On a four month parental leave, I started playing around with creating a web site so the out of town grandparents could see updated pictures. A few tutorials and bunny trails later, I ended up on the blog of Jon Hicks. Several months after that I was firmly entrenched in the cult of Mac and web design was what I wanted to do when I finally grew up.</p>
<p>Sadly, my skills in design and web development were non-existent. But at the very least I could tweak existing WordPress themes and start a blog. And so I did. After time, I realized that I enjoyed writing to a degree &mdash; a large degree. And with the likes of John Gruber earning a great income from only a blog, I thought perhaps there might be a future somewhere for me online.</p>
<p>And so, publishing was more of a detour or an on-ramp, not the end destination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> What was the destination? A sustainable web-based career?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> In essence, yes.</p>
<p>Working in IT in the corporate world was good for a time, but once I started to see what working environments could be like, I desired a change. Politics, red tape and glacial progress (and a dress code) start to wear a person down.</p>
<p>And so I longed for employment that would enable me to create, to use the tools I prefer, and work with smart people. The Internet seemed like the best possibility for that to happen. Design/development was my highest preference, but because I did not have a strong skill set in that area, I thought my chances would be better starting elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Well I can certainly empathize with you there.</p>

<p>Shifting gears a bit, I&rsquo;d like to ask you a bit about your view of the web as a community. You spend a lot of time on your &ldquo;About&rdquo; page discussing what you believe to be a misplaced sense of focus in our online culture. Can you elaborate on that a bit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, feel free to share that it took me three months to answer this question. This is partly due to my own schedule, but also partly because I&rsquo;m constantly evaluating my thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to take the convictions I feel and impose them on others. Thankfully, awareness is the first step of recovery, but I still struggle with drawing a line between what is a general truth and what is simply a personal belief or preference.</p>
<p>On the topic of attention and consumption, it&rsquo;s becoming pretty clear to most people that the internet is changing us and our habits. It&rsquo;s pervasiveness into everywhere is having a cumulative affect. This I have felt (keenly) in my life, but is also coming into focus for much of our culture. So I know I&rsquo;m not just pushing this onto others.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve come to a time in my life where I desire to create more than anything else, many of the habits formed in the past five years are a detriment to that. I struggle greatly to focus on one task for any length. Even if I achieve that focus, I still find myself switching spaces, letting my thoughts drift to other subjects, my fingers seeking that source of new input.</p>
<p>Twitter is the best example of this tension in my life. I love it, I hate it. My career would not be where it is without it, yet I know I could have created more, done more over the past three years if I removed all the time I spent on the service. It brings me useful information and in contact with amazing people, but also can daily cause me to miss important events in the life of my children.</p>
<p>Where then is the balance?</p>
<p>I share all of that to somehow add context to my answer to your question. Does our online culture have a misplaced sense of focus? Partly. Maybe the real issue is more of a lack of focus, period. Either way, I desire for my writing and my home on the net, my blog, to be a place where people settle in, turn off all the distractions, and just enjoy.</p>
<p>Writing is a form of creation, but merely passing content back and forth between many writers does not necessarily equate to writing. That&rsquo;s not to say that sharing links is bad &mdash; but it too must be done with care. A writer who cares should add their own commentary to this form of &lsquo;writing&rsquo;. What a writer shares says something about them, but so does what they have to share about. That&rsquo;s part of what makes Gruber so special.</p>
<p>We are all writers now, but there are not enough good writers, and too few readers. Skimmers abound, but discerning, ingestive readers seem in short supply many days. I don&rsquo;t want to sound harsh, for I have a lot of online friends who are writers. My point is this: I encourage us all to seek depth, whether reading or writing.</p>
<p>Two of my favorite examples of this are Shawn Blanc and Frank Chimero. Shawn takes his time and is well known for this thoroughness. And writing is more of a spin off for Frank, but he writes so well and shares a lot on what creativity is to him. I don&rsquo;t read their work when I sit down to work in the morning. I read it on the weekend, in my favorite chair with a beverage on hand. After reading, I want to sit back and contemplate what they&rsquo;ve written. I want to be inspired by their words.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the embodiment of the good that can come from our online culture, and what I seek from others and strive for myself. If you want to write, do as best you can. Take your time and digest your work before offering it to others. When you&rsquo;re reading, take your time and do it thoroughly as well. Trim that reading list if you have to. Limit your input in order to give yourself time to digest, meditate, and create your own things. Whatever they may be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I must admit that I find myself feeling a bit embarrassed that I don&rsquo;t put nearly that level of effort into my personal blog. But I suppose I&rsquo;ve never really viewed it, in my own mind, as a place for &ldquo;writing&rdquo; as much as a place for sharing. But perhaps that&rsquo;s a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>Intrvws, however, is my attempt at precisely that sort of writing. When I begin an interview have a very clear image in my mind of the audience. I want this to be a publication that people set aside time to read&mdash;not something that they stumble upon as a distraction from their day-to-day.</p>

<p>If I may continue to probe your &ldquo;About&rdquo; page, I noticed that you make a point to share that you&rsquo;re a Christian and that you seek to lead a simple life. I imagine that when most people think &ldquo;live simply&rdquo; they don&rsquo;t imagine a self-employed web advertising professional with a penchant for design and Apple gadgets. Could you share a bit about how your faith, and lifestyle, shape your work and visa versa?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> On your comment about writing and sharing, I agree that it is a distinction without a difference. When we are sharing, we should give the same care and attention because we are telling our audience this &lsquo;something&rsquo; is worth their time. This is the reason my personal blog came to a halt for a time &mdash; I was at a place where I didn&rsquo;t have the time to give it the proper amount of attention. I&rsquo;d rather say nothing than say something halfheartedly.</p>
<p>As for my faith and lifestyle shaping my work, I feel the need to reword that. My desire is that my faith shapes my work and my lifestyle. Whether or not I live it out at all times (and I sure don&rsquo;t), it&rsquo;s my belief that we are created to worship and serve our Creator. But much of our culture encourages self-service and self-worship. Perhaps I&rsquo;m simply a romantic when it comes to history, but despite the fact that life was less comfortable in the past, I feel like it was more likely easier to be spiritually focused. And so I do what I can to keep my life simple so I can cultivate a focus on spirituality in my home.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true that a lot of my interests do not tend to fit the well known stereotypes of the granola eating tree hugger or the meditative zen master. There is truth there &mdash; being fixated on the latest gadget is not really compatible with a simple life. On that note, I&rsquo;m happy that the changes in my career have allowed me to focus more on building a business and growing my skills rather than the latest in tech news.</p>
<p>My interest in that field is waning as well. Apple is making it boring. They are not the underdog anymore and the past five years has seen them settle into an amazingly consistent routine. They continually take their already great products and add just a little more value every year. Take the iPad 2 released recently. I still follow a bit of the news, but mostly I&rsquo;m not interested in the details. The next year or two will see a new iteration that&rsquo;s a little bit better. And a focus on simplicity helps you to remember that your current machine that was top of the line ten months ago still gets the job done.</p>
<p>Now I find myself in a place where I really want to focus on working hard and honing my skills instead of keeping up with the flavor(s) of the week. And that fits in with my beliefs. I still have days where I sit back and consume news, but for the most part my goals keep me focused on moving forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> You mentioned changes in your career. For those readers who may not know you&mdash;or your background&mdash;very well, could you share a bit about what you do on a daily basis, what you did before, and where you see yourself headed in 2011?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I&rsquo;ll start with my past. I have a diploma in Computer Information Systems and spent the first five-six years of my digital career working in the Information Technology field, primarily in health care. This was a nice start and helped me build a lot of soft skills that don&rsquo;t necessarily land you a gig, but help you succeed once you get in the door.</p>
<p>Over time though, the frustrations that come with working for a large, faceless company wore me down. At the same time, I felt a keen pull from the web and the opportunities that were being created there. Web design and self publishing were the two specifics that really grabbed my attention. And thanks to building relationships with people, eventually the doors opened and I was able to make the switch to self-employment.</p>
<p>Now my days can look completely different from one to the next. But relationships are at the core (with publishers and advertisers), so email and Skype take up a big part of my time. Apart from that I spend time doing some writing, a little bit of design and project management, and a good deal of front end web development.</p>
<p>One thing I discovered early about the web is that it allows you to express your creativity. That was absent &mdash; or at the best, very hard to find &mdash; working in a large corporation. So, whether crafting words while writing, creating a design, or organizing front end code, I have the opportunity to exercise my creative muscles.</p>
<p>I crave variety, and am blessed in my work to have that. My goal with my career is to be able to support my family, while working on things I believe and am passionate about. I get to do a lot of different things, and although they are not all pleasant, overall I get a lot of satisfaction from my work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I feel like I&rsquo;ve heard the story in bits and pieces, but never the whole thing. How did Fusion come to be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> If memory serves, it started out with a conversation between Michael Mistretta and Chris Thompson over an online game of MarioKart Wii. It&rsquo;s kind of funny in hindsight, but there you go. After some discussion, Chris set to building an ad server and Michael started contacting a few fellow bloggers who he wanted to invite as members. Last on the list were myself and Shawn Blanc, and Michael asked that if we were interested, we would take on an advisory role.</p>
<p>I guess the idea really started before that. Around the time when chairman Gruber was taking his site full time, I was engrossed with his posts regarding the Deck and quality advertising. Curiosity prompted me to contact Jim Coudal &mdash; not asking to be on the Deck, but simply how they chose their sites. I wrote about my experience and my desire to only ever use attractive means if I were to ever monetize my writing efforts. From there, Michael&rsquo;s idea was spawned.</p>
<p>We soft launched in November 2008, at which time I told Michael I wanted to be involved as more than an adviser. Chris was at that time becoming less involved anyways, so Michael and I decided to push forward. From then on, I dealt with the advertisers and Michael with the publishers.</p>
<p>Over two years later, we&rsquo;re still here. Thankfully!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> And it&rsquo;s quite a history. It&rsquo;s inspiring to think that something as impactful as Fusion was started by such young people.</p>

<p>Recently a number of networks, in addition to The Deck and Fusion, have sprung up using a similar approach: a single, attractive, targeted ad per page. I myself recent joined the Carbon Ads network, and I know there are several more&mdash;-including some in the early stages of development.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how you would characterize the online advertising market (ignoring the AdWords market, etc., if possible) today. How has it changed over the last few years? And how do you feel Fusion distinguishes itself from the growing crowd?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> From all the new ad networks and services popping up all over, it&rsquo;s clear that the space is becoming more competitive. Even beyond our tech and web focused circles, personal publishing is booming and most people (e.g. mommy bloggers) see advertising as the primary source of income. I feel that, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s competition for my company, this movement is a good thing. The more quality advertising out there, the better for all of us.</p>
<p>As for how Fusion distinguishes itself from the crowd &hellip; as an ad service, I would sadly say we haven&rsquo;t as much as I would have liked. We&rsquo;ve made a few attempts that didn&rsquo;t work out (link to here: <a href="http://fusionads.net/blog/2010/textie-and-touchy/">http://fusionads.net/blog/2010/textie-and-touchy/</a> ) and have a few other projects that have taken longer than hoped. That&rsquo;s life though &mdash; I&rsquo;m still confident that we have a vision that will bear fruit in the coming years.</p>
<p>As a part of a vibrant web community, I feel like Fusion has been a little more successful. It&rsquo;s always been our goal to support the community, including the customer (advertisers), the reader and the publisher. Our recent Holiday Bundle was a good example of that &mdash; everyone involved walked away a winner. And we have a few other things on the way that I hope will further cement our involvement in the community.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Indeed. I think your odds are pretty good. I&rsquo;ve certainly found a great many of the websites I love by bulk subscribing to the Fusion OPML file.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned the two aspects of Fusion: the ads and the community. When I think of Fusion I always think about it as a community first, and a business second. I&rsquo;m glad to see that I&rsquo;m not the only one.</p>

<p>Before you started writing at chrisbowler.com you wrote at The Weekly Review. I missed that whole stage of your web experience, and I was wondering if you could share a bit about it. How was The Weekly Review different than chrisbowler.com, and why did you feel you needed to make the change?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, now I have to go back a ways in my mind.</p>
<p>I started The Weekly Review partly because I hoped there was potential for a possible career change and self-employment. It was also partly out of the desire to have a voice and flex my creativity.</p>
<p>The site itself was similar to those I enjoy most &mdash; a personal site where the author is comfortable discussing multiple subjects, but where the focus is on a few areas of passion. For The Weekly Review, the focus was Apple, software, and productivity. I thought the name said it all, but apparently is caused confusion. People thought it was because I planned to review software on a weekly basis, but the name was actually in reference to the concept of doing a weekly review in David Allen&rsquo;s Getting Things Done&trade;.</p>
<p>The idea of taking time to reflect on what has passed, while also looking at what&rsquo;s coming and what you hope to achieve is a romantic notion for this guy. I enjoy quiet and reflection &mdash; I take steps to ensure those opportunities exist &mdash; and the weekly review fit well with that idea. It also makes for a good environment to write. So that was the origin of my first foray into writing.</p>
<p>There were a few factors that led to me moving away from this site. The biggest underlying reason was that I felt forced to write on those three areas of focus I listed above. I often wanted to write on other subjects, but TWR didn&rsquo;t seem like the right place. I was also curious about this new platform called Tumblr and finally started a more personal blog there. Over time, two things happened: I grew tired of updating two blogs and grew tired of the personal productivity scene (not personal productivity itself, or examining how we work, but simply the circus that had grown up around it). So I eventually shut it down and focused on the personal site.</p>
<p>That said, I have to mention that the biggest regret I&rsquo;ve had since getting involved in the internet community has been letting the domain go free. At the time, I saw it as a trimming down, a move toward being minimal and not having clutter. Which is a good goal. I just didn&rsquo;t understand the effect it had on others and the responsibility we have as publishers.</p>
<p>I will not make that mistake again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> You&rsquo;ve recently written a bit about your sleep habits, and the difficulty of finding that time for quiet and reflection in a house full of children and the unavoidable chaos that follows. Not to beat a dead horse, but geez&hellip; how do you find it? And do you think you would have been able to find the balance that you&rsquo;ve found (I know it&rsquo;s an ever-evolving thing.) if you hadn&rsquo;t become self-employed?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> How do I find the time for quiet and reflection? A couple of ways.</p>
<p>Getting up early is one. Shutting things off is another, and is probably a more difficult option. We got rid of cable TV years ago, which was a great start. But I have to stop congratulating myself on that decision if I spend just as much time online, checking Twitter etc. So, unplugging is essential.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have all the answers &mdash; this is still a struggle for me. But I&rsquo;ve found that having other interests is a great help. Spending time in the garden or doing woodwork does wonders for creative thinking. As does exercise (not team sports, but singular sporting activity where you&rsquo;re alone with your thoughts).</p>
<p>As for the second question, I actually think that if I hadn&rsquo;t become self-employed I might have more time for quiet and reflection. I&rsquo;ve found it much harder to be balanced when my work crosses over into my passions and hobbies. Add in the factor that the work space is always a 10 second walk away and balance can be harder to find than when I worked in an office and had much less passion for what my work involved.</p>
<p>Self-employment is a double-edged sword.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> Sure, but what you lose due to difficulty with balance you make up by not having a commute. I, for example, commute anywhere between two and four hours per day, depending on traffic. That&rsquo;s essentially dead time for me.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago you were writing about your experiment with burning the candle on both ends (otherwise known as sleeping less). How&rsquo;s that been working out for you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Absolutely fantastic. After my two weeks of trying to get by on 5 hours per night (excluding the weekends), I thought to myself that the experiment would be much better off if I tried the opposite as well. So rather than going back to my usual 6.5 to 7 hours per night, I tried my best to get around 8 hours per night for one week.</p>
<p>And I felt great. Surprisingly so.</p>
<p>It made me realize that despite the fact I&rsquo;d been getting by on a lower than average amount of sleep for the better part of two years, I may still be better off sleeping more. My purpose has always been to be disciplined with my sleep so that I carved out time for quiet and meditation, as well as some extra work time. But after the two weeks of less sleep, I also realized that it&rsquo;s way too easy to slip into spending all that extra time focused on work. And 10 hour days of just work end up feeling like &hellip; well, work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I want.</p>
<p>Now I simply try my best to find a good balance: more sleep on average, more focus on actual work when I&rsquo;m in front of the screen, and I&rsquo;ve changed my morning routine. No more work, email, twitter or RSS until breakfast is over. My morning&rsquo;s start around 5:30 &ndash; 6:00 AM, but that time is focused completely on reading Scripture, prayer, meditation (not Zen-ish eastern mediation, let&rsquo;s call it contemplation), and reading of non-fiction works.</p>
<p>The combination of a little more sleep and no digital distractions until the work day starts has made my mornings more rewarding than they&rsquo;ve been for quite some time. I&rsquo;m calling the experiment a success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> I&rsquo;m curious, because I&rsquo;ve been going through a bit of a similar experiment over the last month. In my case, I&rsquo;ve found that tweaking my routine, focus, and priorities have helped me be much more effective in some areas&mdash;-I think the right ones&mdash;-but at the expense of a lot of my hobbies. It&rsquo;s not so much that I&rsquo;m working too much, but that I&rsquo;m not ignoring many of the responsibilities at home that I had been.</p>

<p>Are you finding by sleeping more, and changing your routine, you&rsquo;re ultimately finding yourself able to spend more time&mdash;-or perhaps better time&mdash;-on your wants rather than solely your needs?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Hmm, my answer may be fairly unsatisfying. I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of having my primary hobby become my work. So, in that regard, I get way more time pursuing my wants than I have in the past when working for someone else. And taking care of my wants takes care of my needs, monetarily at least.</p>
<p>As for other needs &mdash; chores around the house, education of our children, spiritual leadership of the home &mdash; I get more time to spend on those than I have in the past. There still remains a void for other hobbies (wants) that do not get my attention. I&rsquo;d love to do more woodwork, more gardening, more fishing etc. But with a large family that is still very young, I know those things will come.</p>
<p>The biggest change that has benefited me has simply been making sure I&rsquo;m unplugged in the early mornings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> One of the last things I&rsquo;m wondering is a bit about you as a father. You&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the last few years reflecting on the meaning of life, what&rsquo;s important, and how to live accordingly. How do you hope to convey that to your children? Or do you think that it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that one has to learn through experience?</p>

<p>For example, I know a lot of very religious people who were, at one point, agnostics or atheists despite having been raised in a very religious environment. They ultimately &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; faith on their own, but it took time, experience, and, well, life to get them there. Do you think that&rsquo;s been the case for you? Or is it your hope that you&rsquo;ll be able to instill your values in your children so they&rsquo;ll be able to jump ahead on the learning curve.</p>

<p>A bit of an odd question, perhaps. But as a father I think about these things a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> The best way to convey my beliefs to my children is by acting on them. Living them out.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;being religious&rdquo; is the last thing I want to be &mdash; partly because it&rsquo;s the wrong way to approach spirituality and partly because I know I have tendencies that lean towards the comfort of routine. Overall though, it seems obvious to me that, at some point in their life, children have to make faith their own. Getting by on your parents&rsquo; faith is not going to help in the long run.</p>
<p>In my case, I wasn&rsquo;t raised in a home where the name of Christ was preached. Yet here I am, a professing Christian and child of God. And, as you mentioned, even in the best run home, one completely focused on living life like Christ, children can still choose another path. So it can go either way.</p>
<p>All I can do is teach them the truth, and do my best to live it out in my daily life. And confess and repent when I make my mistakes. Each night, I simply want to be able to look back on the day and feel good about where my time was invested. Hopefully, the focus is on my relationship with my Father, my family, and then my friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>At this point in my life, the biggest obstacle to that is being connected (online), which is why the subject comes up so much in my writing.</p>

<p><strong>Ian:</strong> It&rsquo;s been a pleasure to have the chance to speak with you. Thank you for taking the time.</p>
