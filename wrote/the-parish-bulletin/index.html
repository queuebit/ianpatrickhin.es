        The Parish Bulletin
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>I can say with confidence that your parish is publishing a weekly ‘bulletin.’ It contains the names and contact information of clergy and parish administrators, a weekly message from the priest, a schedule of events and a bucket load of advertisements. But does anyone read it? How do you know?</p>

<p>Oh, sure, people take it. It’s practically shoved into their hands as they leave mass. But do they read it. The truth is that you have no idea — and neither does your priest.</p>

<p><em>Nearly everything that’s published in the weekly bulletin could, and should, be published online.</em> Exclusively online, where it’s always available and its use can be measured. It would be far cheaper to publish a single, responsive and dynamic website than to print and distribute thousands of paper bulletins each week. And it would also be more accessible and useful for parishioners. And no, uploading a PDF of your print bulletin doesn’t count.</p>

<p>So why don’t more parishes go web-only? Two reasons: know-how and economics.</p>

<p><em>The truth is that most priests — and most parish staff — still don’t know how to effectively use the Internet to organize their parish community.</em> The don’t know where to start — or, worse, might think they’re already doing it well — so they just keep doing what they’re doing. That’s a tough problem to solve, but its solvable.</p>

<p>The more vexing problem is economic. Parishes earn money from those annoying bulletins. Yep — the advertising. Many parishes cannot afford to phase out their antiquated and low-performing bulletins because they’re reliant on the advertising pages to keep their financial heads above water. This creates a perverse incentive: what’s best for the parish’s pocketbook is not what’s best for its evangelical mission.</p>

<p>In the 21st-century, Catholic parishes must pivot their engagement strategies to meet people where they are: online. I am literally typing this blog post on a mobile computer I carry in my pocket. Most people carry a computer in their pocket. They search the web on the go. They do not keep their bulletins long enough to reference them on Sunday afternoon, much less later that week.</p>

<p>So in the coming week, I am going to tear apart my own parish bulletin to show how it can be better done online. I’ll publish a new post here outlining how a different aspect of the bulletin could be reflected on a website like this one. And maybe, just maybe, one of you will take one of those ideas back to your parish community and give it a go.</p>

<p>Note: This post was originally published on Catholic Nation, a short-lived side project of mine. I&rsquo;ve reposted it here for posterity.</p>
