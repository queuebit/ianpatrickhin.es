  <p>After giving it a lot of thought I decided on Thursday to port IanHines.com from <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. (I use the term &ldquo;port&rdquo; lightly, because there was absolutely nothing straightforward to the process and it certainly was not as simple as exporting and importing entries.) My hope was that this change would be so transparent that the end-user (i.e., you) would not notice any difference.</p>

<p>After giving it a lot of thought I decided on Thursday to port IanHines.com from <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. (I use the term &ldquo;port&rdquo; lightly, because there was absolutely nothing straightforward to the process and it certainly was not as simple as exporting and importing entries.) My hope was that this change would be so transparent that the end-user (i.e., you) would not notice any difference.</p>

<h2>First of all, why move?</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: Tumblr is an exceptionally nice blogging platform. It&rsquo;s fun to use, has an attractive backend, is sufficiently (and easily) customizable for most users, and makes it incredibly easy to input. Tumblr is a blogger&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/09/yojimbo-and-anything-buckets/">anything bucket</a>,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not for everyone. Turns out it&rsquo;s not for me.</p>

<p>In my opinion there are only a few drawbacks associated with Tumblr, but they are significant. The first, and in my view most important, drawback of Tumblr is its inability to export entries using an industry standard format. I know about the <a href="http://blog.ianhines.com/asides/tumblr-backup-beta/">Backup Utility</a>: it&rsquo;s great for storing permanent copies of your data on your hard drive but awful if you want to leave Tumblr for another <span class="caps">CMS</span> (like WordPress or ExpressionEngine). CMSs get change over time&mdash;for better or worse&mdash;sometimes leaving their users seeking another option (see The Great Movable Type Exodus of 2004), and I didn&rsquo;t like feeling as though I was trapped in Tumblr.</p>

<p>The second reason was more cosmetic: I wanted more granular control over the theme. Specifically, I wanted to be able to format the <a href="http://blog.ianhines.com/sitemap">archives</a>. In Tumblr, all blogs are forced to use a standardized archives page and, well, it&rsquo;s ugly. Using WordPress allows me to theme my archives, making the entire site more cohesive and, I think, professional.</p>

<h2>How I Did It</h2>

<p>Because of the limitations of Tumblr&mdash;specifically its inability to export entries in an importable format&mdash;moving the blog to WordPress was a very, very onerous process. Here&rsquo;s how I did it:</p>

<ol>
<li>I installed WordPress at a new subdomain, <a href="http://blog.ianhines.com/">blog.ianhines.com</a>, using (mt) Media Temple&rsquo;s <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/features/">One-Click Installation</a>. Piece of cake.</li>
<li>Configured WordPress&rsquo;s settings, particularly Permalink Settings so that new entries would render with the proper URLs.</li>
<li>Created a spreadsheet to track <span class="caps">URL</span> changes.</li>
<li>Created a corresponding Category in WordPress for each content-type in Tumblr: Text, Links, Photographs, Videos, etc.</li>
<li>Manually re-entered each individual post into WordPress, back-dating them so that they appear to have been posted on their original date. Using the spreadsheet created in Step #3, I tracked each <span class="caps">URL</span> change (Old (Tumblr) <span class="caps">URL</span> &rarr; New (WordPress) <span class="caps">URL</span>).</li>
<li>Reformatted my Tumblr theme to work with WordPress. I started with the <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/starkers/">Starkers theme</a> by <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/">Elliot Jay Stocks</a> (Thanks <a href="http://tightwind.net/">Kyle</a> for that advice!) and I have to say this was the easiest time building a WordPress theme I&rsquo;ve ever had.</li>
<li>Lastly, using the spreadsheet from Steps #3 <span class="amp">&amp;</span> #5, I made a extraordinarily long .htacces file manually redirecting each individual post from their Tumblr URLs to their new, cleaner WordPress URLs. This part, in particular, was quite tedious&mdash;but also incredibly rewarding.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result should be a blog that was seamlessly moved from one <span class="caps">URL</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">CMS</span> to another. There were only two elements that did not make the move gracefully:</p>

<ol>
<li>The comments, which I could not move.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ianhines">Feedburner Feed</a>, which republished all the most recent entries when I moved its source from Tumblr to WordPress. Apologies to my subscribers for the duplications; I hope it wasn&rsquo;t too big an inconvenience.</li>
</ol>

<p>When all is said and done, though, this was a change that was made for my benefit, not yours. You really shouldn&rsquo;t see much in terms of outward difference. The backend, however, has changed dramatically and for the better.</p>
