<article class="block">
  <p>I think it was about this time last year that I originally had the idea to interview people. I had come to realize that I was spending a significant portion of my day, every day, reading tweets and blog posts by virtual strangers. I knew an awful lot about what they thought about their obsessions, but very little about <em>them</em>. I didn&rsquo;t know them as people, only editorial voices.</p>

<p>That would not do.</p>

<p>I remember quite distinctly that someone had told me that one of the best ways to learn something is to ask leading questions and listen. I had read a number of interviews on other blogs&mdash;most notably by <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/interviews/">Shawn Blanc</a>&mdash;and thought &ldquo;what a neat way to get to know everyone.&rdquo; So I started asking people: &ldquo;would you be interested in doing an interview for my blog?&rdquo; Not a single person said no.</p>

<p>But, as so often is the case with best laid plans, life happened. I lost my job, and began taking interviews for new positions. A lot of interviews. And a question kept creeping up in them: &ldquo;can you tell me a little bit about your blog?&rdquo;</p>

<p>See, I work in a business where having a blog can be a particularly dicey affair. For that reason I try to keep a very stark separation between my personal affairs and my professional ones but, not knowing me, potential employers understandably felt that my blog presented too great a risk to them. After watching a few promising positions slip through my fingers, I decided it was time: the blog had to go.</p>

<p>I was truly blessed that I was only out of work for about a month, which in this economy is certainly more a cause for thanksgiving. With the paralyzing fear of longterm unemployment behind me (and trust me, it is a paralyzing fear), I gradually resumed my hobby but with a much diminished readership and no real sense of direction.</p>

<h2>From Interviews to Intrvws</h2>

<p>When I withdrew my blog, I offered each of the interviewees the opportunity to publish their interviews&mdash;which were in various stages of completion&mdash;to their respective websites so that they would not have been done in vain. They did, and much to my surprise the response was resoundingly enthusiastic. It seems that I was not the only person eager to learn more about the people behind the writing.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://intrv.ws/">Intrvws</a>, as a dedicated project, didn&rsquo;t begin to take shape until several months later. It wasn&rsquo;t until <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/">Patrick Rhone</a>, whose <a href="http://therandompost.com/post/487302744/the-ian-hines-interviews">early encouragement</a> cannot be overstated, convinced me that this was a project worth pursuing that I decided it deserved a home of its own. He couldn&rsquo;t have been more right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled for rather a long time with a desire to create something that touched people. I&rsquo;ve never been a particularly gifted artist, musician, or writer&mdash;and I know that. I can&rsquo;t really build things, either&mdash;digital or otherwise.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a verbal person. A professional talker. But as a web enthusiast, I&rsquo;ve always struggled to find a way to translate that passion for conversation and discussion into to something special to share with others in a medium so dominated by print and images.</p>

<p>But now I think I may have finally found a way.</p>

<p>When I set out to conduct an interview, my goal is to steer a conversation that brings out the best in the interviewee&mdash;and the reader. It&rsquo;s really not about me at all. And maybe that&rsquo;s what makes it so fun.</p>

<p>I want Intrvws to be the sort of website where the readers await the next installment with anticipation. I&rsquo;m not keeping it on a strict schedule&mdash;it&rsquo;s far more important that the interviews have the time to develop naturally than that I post by some artificial deadline. I also don&rsquo;t start the interviews with a pre-planned set of questions. It&rsquo;s not really a Q<span class="amp">&amp;</span>A at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s a conversation meant for sharing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know where Intrvws is going. I don&rsquo;t know how many I&rsquo;ll do, or how often. I don&rsquo;t really have a plan at all. All I know is that I want to create the sort of content that readers decline to read when it&rsquo;s published in favor of sending it to <a href="http://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to read with their Sunday morning coffee.</p>
