        Death and Life

<article class="block">
  <p>They say that dying is a part of living, and I believe that. In fact, I try not to dwell on death, despite my human inclination to do so, because I believe that dying is precisely that: a transition to the next phase of your life, not the end of it. I&rsquo;m not usually very successful&hellip; but I try.</p>

<p>In the last 24 hours I&rsquo;ve experienced an odd juxtaposition of life and death that has broadened my worldview and magnified my appreciation for life. I&rsquo;d like to share some thoughts I&rsquo;ve had with you, for what they&rsquo;re worth.</p>

<p>In approximately ten hours my son will be Baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. For the past nearly three months he has been living with the blemish of Original Sin, but tomorrow morning he will be blessed by God and forgiven through the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Even in the most ordinary of circumstances it would be a humbling experience, but in light of the events of recent days it has taken on a whole different meaning for me.</p>

<p>I was informed today of the death of two people who I knew only a little, but whose lives have touched me in more ways that I know. The first was the father of a professional colleague who I greatly admire. He died in old age, with the company of family and friends, and with the benefit of anticipation: I mean to say that he was lucky enough to have seen his end approaching, and therefore have the opportunity to set his affairs in order and make the most of the time remaining.</p>

<p>Death is never easy, but I hope that when I face mine it is under similar circumstances. I know nothing about the manner in which he passed &ndash; I do not know what ailed him, if it was painful, or if he was ready when his time came &ndash; but I do know that his death was expected to some degree, and that &ndash; having experienced the deaths of three of my own grandparents &ndash; such knowledge can provide some comfort to one&rsquo;s loved ones (though it does not feel that way at the time).</p>

<p>The second person died in a much different fashion. She was the mother of a childhood friend who I knew as a Den Mother when I was a Cub Scout. I remember her only a little, but those memories that I have are fond and full of warmth and welcome. What I cannot remember I can infer from the wonderful man her son &ndash; my old friend &ndash; grew up to be.</p>

<p>She passed in a manner &ndash; due to complications from an operation &ndash; that serves as a clear reminder of the fragility in which we all live our daily lives. Her death was unexpected and with little warning, serving as a clear reminder &ndash; at least to me &ndash; that every day should be approached with humility and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>That these two individuals on the periphery of my daily life both passed on the eve of my son&rsquo;s Baptism &ndash; a symbol of new life and new beginning in Christ &ndash; has caused me to reflect on the beauty of life&rsquo;s mystery in a way I may not otherwise have done. In a strange way I am grateful: not for their suffering, but for the way God has used this moment to magnify a greater good.</p>

<p>So I guess here&rsquo;s my thought&hellip;</p>

<p>Live life to the fullest; do good for others; take chances; be bold; don&rsquo;t make excuses; dream big dreams. Your life &ndash; whether it ends in old age or in a sudden and unexpected accident &ndash; will be relatively short. Act accordingly.</p>
