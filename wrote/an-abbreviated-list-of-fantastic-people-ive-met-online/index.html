        An Abbreviated List of Fantastic People I've Met Online
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Internet for some time. In that time I&rsquo;ve built up a fairly long list of people who I&rsquo;ve met, but never really met. Those of you who blog, tweet, and actually use an <span class="caps">RSS</span> Feed reader know what I&rsquo;m talking about: the Internet friends with whom you chat all the time, and whose &ldquo;company&rdquo; you really enjoy, but have never met for a coffee and who may live half-a-world away. I thought I&rsquo;d take a few minutes and jot down a short, non-comprehensive list of these folks I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed meeting through the years; hopefully it will help introduce you to someone new.</p>

<h3>Kyle Baxter (<a href="http://tightwind.net/">tightwind.net</a>)</h3>

<p>Kyle is a different breed of blogger. Oh, sure, he writes about tech as much as the rest of us&mdash;but he also writes about democratic reforms in China, the Fed, and post-American foreign policy. Kyle covers it all, and does so in a surprisingly readable manner. He writes excellent <a href="http://ianpatrickhin.es/wrote-about/content">content</a>, not just copy.</p>

<p>But more than that, he takes it a step further: he&rsquo;s glad to discuss his articles with you further. In fact, that&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.tightwind.net/colophon/">very point</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, feel free to contact me if you want to discuss something I wrote or just have something to say. You can email me, or message me on Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He means it. I can&rsquo;t tell you how great it is to get a personal email response from the author of a great piece. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place where you can read incredibly well thought-out content written by a genuinely nice and very approachable guy, <a href="http://www.tightwind.net/">TightWind</a> by Kyle Baxter is it.</p>

<h3>Sam Brown (<a href="http://sam.brown.tc/">sam.brown.tc</a>)</h3>

<p>Sam is another one who, like Kyle, makes his blog incredibly personable. Like most of the bloggers I read he focuses on web-design, blogging, and the like; unlike most of the blogs I read he still allows comments on his pieces. And boy, do people comment. Rare is the moment when I see an entry on his blog that doesn&rsquo;t have umpteen articulate comments awaiting me.</p>

<p>But the hallmark of Sam Brown is the emails: Sam replies to every comment via email with a personal message. It&rsquo;s an incredibly personal touch, and it really makes you feel connected to him&mdash;despite having never met him in your life.</p>

<p>Oh, and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt that he&rsquo;s from Edinburgh&mdash;one of my favorite cities on the planet.</p>

<h3>Pat Dryburgh (<a href="http://patdryburgh.com/">patdryburgh.com</a>)</h3>

<p>In the last few months I&rsquo;ve come to learn that there&rsquo;s a lot more to Pat than first meets the eye. When I first came upon his blog (then patdryburgh.net) it was as minimalist as can be. Little did I know that he was an incredibly capable and talented graphic and web designer responsible for many of the brilliant <a href="http://fusionads.com/">Fusion Ads</a> that have opened my wallet these past months.</p>

<p>If you like smart, approachable, down-to-Earth guys you should take a second to get to know Pat. He&rsquo;s right up there with the best of them.</p>

<h3>Jorge Quinteros (<a href="http://jorgeq.com/">jorgeq.com</a>)</h3>

<p>Jorge lives my alter-ego: he studied Graphic Design, lives in Brooklyn, takes wonderful photographs, and travels the world (all things I wish I could have done). He seems like he&rsquo;s always around on Twitter, waiting to answer that question I have or put two-cents towards something I&rsquo;ve been on the fence about. And you know what? It&rsquo;s always welcome.</p>

<p>Whenever I have a question about something it seems like he&rsquo;s already written an entry six months ago that perfectly answers it. He&rsquo;s outgoing, easy going, and going places (that was too clich&eacute; not to write <del>and true, to boot</del>). Get to know him: you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>

<h3>Jasmin Wong (<a href="http://jasminwong.com/">jasminwong.com</a>)</h3>

<p>To be entirely honest, I can&rsquo;t remember how I met Jasmin: but I&rsquo;m glad that I did. As I&rsquo;ve followed her from intherain.org, to sootcolumns.org, and ultimately to some.fancypiece.org I&rsquo;ve come to know Jasmin as a smart, kind, and thoughtful person. In fact, she&rsquo;s so thoughtful that this past Christmas she sent me a Christmas Card all the way from Australia even though we&rsquo;d never actually met!</p>

<p>Jasmin is currently stepping up her work as a freelance web designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> photographer, so if you&rsquo;re in Australia and are in the market you should definitely give her a look. (She has a natural eye for portraits, in my humble opinion.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Internet is full of great, great people&mdash;and not just the ones you already know. The great magic of the web is that it has the power to connect similar people across great distances, and the people I&rsquo;ve met along the way have immeasurably improved my life these past years.</p>

<p>When people ask me why I spend to much time and energy with social media, I now have one simple answer to give them: it&rsquo;s the people. Thanks, to all of you.</p>
