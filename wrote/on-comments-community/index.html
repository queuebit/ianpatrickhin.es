        On Comments & Community
      </h1>

<article class="block">
  <p>When I first started writing online in any focused way, &ldquo;comments&rdquo; were ubiquitous. Everyone&rsquo;s site had comments enabled for each and every post. In fact, I dare say I would hardly have considered my site a blog if it hadn&rsquo;t had comments.</p>

<p>Oh, how things have changed.</p>

<p>These days, so few personal blogs have comments enabled that I — when I see one — I&rsquo;m struck by the oddity of it. It&rsquo;s hard for me to put a date on when this shift occurred, but it has definitely been a marked shift during the time I&rsquo;ve been online. And I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s for the better. So I’m bringing comments back to my blog. I hope that you’ll use them.</p>

<h2>Why Disqus and not Branch?</h2>

<p>There’s been a lot of buzz lately about <a href="http://branch.com/">Branch</a>, a new discussion platform from the guys that brough you Twitter. It’s really very well done. I’d describe it as a sort of invite-only comment thread that’s hosted off-site — which is both it’s strength and its weakness.</p>

<p>Branch’s goal is to encourage deep, meaningful discussion — the sorts of discussion that can’t really happen on Twitter, and that can only happen in private via email. That’s valuable, and I’ve seen circumstances where it’s really well used. But I don’t think it’s right for a blog.</p>

<p>Blog comments should be tied very clearly back to the original post, because they are a response. And the barrier to contributing should be as low as possible in order to weed out spambots and trolls. <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> accomplishes this very well, and in an elegant and simple interface, to boot.</p>

<h2>What’s the point? Aren’t comments a distraction?</h2>

<p>I don’t think so. I’ve been paying a lot of attention lately to the sites I read that have comments, and — overwhelmingly — I have found that they add value. They provide a sense of conversation and community that seems otherwise lacking on the blog circuit today.</p>

<p>Most often, they don’t play home to thoughtful discussion. And that’s okay. It’s the little comments — the “hey, thanks for linking to my post” or the “this post really meant something to me” — that make comments so worthwhile. And sure, that sort of interaction can happen with a simple tweet or email, but (I think) there’s benefit to doing it in public.</p>

<h2>A blog is a community</h2>

<p>So if something I write here resonates with you, please let me know in the comments. If you disagree, let me know in the comments. If you link to one of my posts, give me a heads up in the comments. Comment. Comment. Comment. Or don’t. It’s up to you. You get out of it what you put into it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I’m not writing because I like to live in my own echo chamber, and I’m not writing for my health. I’m writing to share what I know / think / feel with you on a human level, and I think that that experience is enhanced by dialog.</p>

<p>If you agree — awesome. If not, I’d love to hear why… in the comments.</p>
