<article class="block">
  <p>A few weeks ago I&nbsp;<a href="http://log.ianhines.com/post/298770973/make-your-mockup-in-markup-by-meagan-fisher">shared</a>&nbsp;an article on 24ways.org&mdash;&ldquo;<a href="http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup">Make Your Mockup in Markup</a>&rdquo; by&nbsp;<a href="http://owltastic.com/">Meagan Fisher</a>&mdash;that argued &ldquo;a website&rsquo;s design should begin where it&rsquo;s going to live: in the browser.&rdquo; At the time I mentioned that, as a hobbyist web-designer with little-to-no graphic design experience this walkthrough was incredibly helpful. At the time I shared the link I hadn&rsquo;t yet attempted to put Meagan&rsquo;s advice to practice; yesterday I did, and look what happened.</p>

<p>The current design of this website is a direct result of implementing the &ldquo;Mockup in Markup&rdquo; approach, and I have to say that I&rsquo;m quite pleased. Essentially it&rsquo;s nothing more than a very content-centric design (with absolutely no graphics aside from my photograph on the&nbsp;<a href="http://ianhines.com/about/">about page</a>) coated in a layer of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a>&nbsp;framed in a&nbsp;<a href="http://960.gs/">960px Grid</a>. But, perhaps not surprisingly, that&rsquo;s all it took. Of course, that was a no brainer decision for me: I&rsquo;ve never been big on graphic and imagery in websites, particularly in blogs. I prefer to keep it simple and content focused, which hopefully this design does.</p>

<p>One thing Meagan emphasized a lot&mdash;and which I&rsquo;ve heard echoed among a lot of designers I admire&mdash;is the logic &amp; value of putting content before design so that the ultimate design compliments and enhances the content. I can&rsquo;t think of any environment in which this is more important&mdash;and, ideally, more simple&mdash;than on a blog in which I write all the content. I had a wealth of content to work with during the design process, and as I tested the various templates (text, links, quotes, etc.) I was able to test them with my content, rather than using Lorem Ipsum. I think that the result was a design that conveyed the tone of my voice &amp; personality, as it should.</p>

<p>This was also my first attempt at hand-coding a Tumblr theme from scratch so I&rsquo;m sure there are things I&rsquo;ve overlooked &amp; bugs to be worked out. One of the benefits of using your own design as a guinea pig is that you have to live with whatever bugs you&rsquo;ve created, which forces you to fix them more quickly. Please be patient as I work through them over the next several weeks.</p>

<p>Lastly, because this was the first time I&rsquo;ve build a Tumblr theme a few things werebrought to my attention that I had not previously considered: (1) If you&rsquo;re using the Hi-Res Photo tag it should auto-default to the 500px image if no Hi-Res Photo is available so that people using wide layouts (like this one) can use the Hi-Res image as the default, and (2) You should be able to theme the Archives so that they appear to be part of a cohesive site. Otherwise theming Tumblr was a dream: very simple, very versatile.</p>

<p>All that said, I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts! You can reach me by&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ian@ianhines.com?subject=I%20Found%20a%20Bug!">email</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/ianhines">twitter</a>&nbsp;almost anytime.</p>
