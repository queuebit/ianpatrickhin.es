<article class="block">

<p>Over the past ten years, I’ve tried just about every productivity and task management system you can name. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH12088?locale=en_US">Apple Reminders</a>, <a href="http://asana.com/">Asana</a>, <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> (Classic and Basecamp 2!), <a href="https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/6062813?hl=en">Google Reminders</a>, <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a>, <a href="http://wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>, etc. You name it, I’ve tried it. And nothing ever felt quite right.</p>

<p>When I worked on a team, however, these trials were all more-or-less academic. I had to use whatever system the boss put in place, whether I liked it or not, But since I started <a href="http://the.beag.co/">The BEAG Co.</a>, it’s been my responsibility to establish and maintain our internal processes for task management and internal &amp; client communications. And after about two-years of trial and error, I ultimately settled on Basecamp 3.</p>

<p>Let me tell you why.</p>

<h2>Office? What office? We work in Basecamp.</h2>

<p>As of this writing, BEAG is a remote team of three people living in three states. We’re currently serving 14 clients across 5 countries. We don’t have an office. We have Basecamp.</p>

</figure>

<p>We’ve been <a href="http://37signals.com/remote">a remote team</a> from Day One. When I first began the work that would eventually become BEAG, I was a freelancer based in Los Angeles. Not long after, I moved back home to Maryland, where I eventually established the company officially. My first hire—<a href="https://medium.com/u/54ec24498cf7">Phil Kregel</a>—lives in Los Angeles, as well, and my second—<a href="https://medium.com/u/c13ff00be694">Richie Alicea</a>—lives in Washington, DC. We’re currently serving clients across the United States, as well as in Australia, the Caribbean, France, and the United Kingdom. And to us, all this feels quite natural—<em>preferable</em>, even.</p>

<p>But it wouldn’t be possible for us to do the work we do without Basecamp <em>(or something like it)</em>. We’ve tried various combinations of tools, like Slack and Asana, but they never quite felt right. It wasn’t until the launch of Basecamp 3 that we finally found an all-around champ that gave us the tools we needed to manage and grow our business.</p>

<p>With the advent of Basecamp 3, the tool became more than just a project management tool. Now, each basecamp <em>(intentionally lowercased)</em> functions almost like a channel in Slack — we make them on the fly and each meets a specific niche need inside our business. But unlike Slack channels, individual basecamps are more than just chat rooms — they give us a customizable combination of <a href="https://basecamp.com/3/tools">six tools</a> to help us tackle the work in front of us. And that customizability is key: we use individual basecamps for a variety of internal and client projects, and each looks a little bit different.</p>

<p>Internally, we have several ongoing basecamps for running the business on a day-to-day <em>(including some that’re just for fun)</em>. Each of them is prefaced by “BEAG: ” to help us quickly tell them apart from client-facing basecamps, and serves a unique purpose. The following are a few examples.</p>

<h3>“The Office”</h3>

<p>“The Office” is our primary internal basecamp. It’s a bit of a catch-all space for internal company updates, chatter, scheduling, etc. Our office “water cooler,” if you will.</p>

<p>Throughout most days, we’re chatting in this basecamp’s “campfire.” It’s the place for small talk, saying “good morning,” and quick questions. The message board is home to “company wide” emails: news policies, reminders, updates, and so forth.</p>

<h3>Business Development and Invoicing</h3>

<p>These two internal projects are crucial to our company’s success, and—<em>I hope</em>—pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<p><strong>Business Development</strong> is where we track our project pipeline. Yes, yes, I know there are plenty of apps and services particularly designed for tracking biz dev flows—and we used to use a full-blown CRM for it—but we’ve found that basecamp works great for us. It’s not too complicated: we create a new “message board” thread for each project lead and log responses to that thread as the conversation with that potential client moves forward.</p>

<p><strong>Invoicing</strong> is—perhaps—even more important. We don’t have a dedicated admin employee. That work falls to me, and I often loose track of it amid the hustle &amp; bustle of “the work.” The “Invoicing” basecamp is crucial in helping me stay on top of it. The basecamp consists of to-do lists—nothing else—and in it I set due dates for each client invoice from the start of a project to its completion. Simple &amp; effective.</p>

<h3>Employee 1+1s</h3>

<p>These are more aspirational than real at the moment, but the idea is to have a private (just for two people) basecamp for each 1+1 direct report relationship. That way the employee &amp; manager have a private, shared space for notes, documents, follow up tasks, etc., from their 1+1 meetings.</p>

<p>I say it’s aspirational because I haven’t been very good about actually having 1+1 meetings, yet. It’s a goal.</p>

<h2>Two kinds of client projects, but a basecamp for each</h2>

<p>Basecamp is great for our internal project, but it really shines when we use it with clients. In fact, that’s what makes Basecamp so much better than other, similar platforms: it’s designed to be used for client services <em>(though not necessarily the way we’re doing it)</em>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, we have two sorts of client project: short-term projects with clear deliverables and long-term projects where we become an everyday (remote) part of the client’s team. The former is <a href="https://basecamp.com/3/clientside">exactly what Basecamp was designed for</a>, while the latter is a bit of an unusual use case, and so we vary our use of the platform accordingly.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Projects</h3>

<p>On our short term projects, we use Basecamp almost exactly the way that they describe it in their marketing materials: Our team tracks to-dos, discussions, etc., in a basecamp <em>(generally one per client, rather than one per deliverable)</em> and the client’s primary contact(s) are looped into the “<a href="https://basecamp.com/3/clientside">clientside.</a>”</p>

<p>This has worked out pretty well for us, though there were some early mistakes and lessons learned. Having some from Basecamp 2, where we gave full transparency in our basecamp <em>(née “project”)</em> to the client, essentially <em>over</em>-communicating, limiting our clients to the clientside was a major shift. The first few times we worked within this model, we accidentally <em>under</em>-communicated because—honestly—we forgot we had to update them regularly on how things were going. Lesson learned.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Now, we routinely create an “automatic check-in” to ask whether we need to check in with the client every weekday. We don’t need to check in with them every day, per se, but that way we don’t loose track of it.</p>

<h3>Ongoing retainer projects</h3>

<p>Our best <em>(i.e., most interesting &amp; profitable)</em> projects are ongoing strategic and support retainers. On those projects, we’re less in a “client services” role than in a “remote part of your everyday team” role. As such, our approach to using Basecamp is considerably different.</p>

<p>Rather than looping our clients into the “clientside” and updating them on our progress on a regular basis, our goal is to loop them into the full project.</p>

<p>I say “our goal” because not every client is interested or able to participate in that way: some view Basecamp as “a whole new thing” they don’t want to learn, and that’s fine. For those folks, we just take the “short-term project” approach and leave it at that. But most clients appreciate the increased transparency and ability to integrate with our process 100%, and we find that including them as partners in the basecamp reduces email communication significantly.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/assets/basecamp-6.png">

</figure>

<p>By including our ongoing retainer clients as fully invested members of their project’s basecamp, we’re able to truly work hand-in-glove as a team. There’s never any question about what’s to-do and “to-done,” and that makes us far more confident and productive.</p>

<h2>Beyond Projects: Little big details that make the difference</h2>

<p>There are a bunch of “little big details” we love about working in Basecamp that are worth mentioning here.</p>

<h3>“Work Can Wait”</h3>

<p>One of the most fantastic additions to Basecamp in its most recent update was what they call “<a href="https://medium.com/woah-basecamp-3/basecamp-3-work-can-wait-4adfb285c84b#.rvhqqyb0m">work can wait</a>.” It’s a totally new feature that allows you to add some sanity to your work-life balance by snoozing notifications on the server side when you’re off-the-clock.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/assets/basecamp-7.jpeg">
</figure>

<p>While you can’t make it mandatory, I strongly encourage my team to make use of this feature. Our work is important—no doubt—and our clients (which are mostly political campaigns) often work around the clock, but that doesn’t mean we have to. If something’s truly urgent, the client will pick up the phone and call. Otherwise, work can wait until morning.</p>

<h3>Pings</h3>

<p>Pings aren’t too complicated: they’re direct messages to other team members within Basecamp, and they work great. Since we started using Basecamp our Google Hangouts (text, not video) use has been reduced to effectively zero.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/assets/basecamp-8.jpeg">
</figure>

<h3>Search &amp; Reporting</h3>

<p>I’m not sure my team likes this very much, but it’s huge for me as a manager. At any given time I can drill down into any aspect of the work that I need to.</p>

<p>What’s ______ been working on? What did ______ say about ______ the other day? What is overdue? What’s on the docket this week? It’s all at my fingertips, and that saves me a ton of time and stress.</p>

<figure>

<h2>Honorable Mention: Other crucial apps and services</h2>

<p>Basecamp is the backbone of our business infrastructure, but there are a handful of other apps &amp; services we use on a daily basis that would be hard—but not impossible—to live without.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nationbuilder.com/">NationBuilder</a>, which we use on nearly every client project as the core of their digital &amp; field infrastructure.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.google.com/">Google Apps for Work</a>. Nearly everything we don’t create in Basecamp or NationBuilder we create in Google Apps. It’s absolutely indispensable.</li>
<li><a href="http://hellosign.com/">HelloSign</a>. Every client project has a contract, and every client contract gets signed through HelloSign. (The Google Docs integration is clutch.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a>. We use Harvest to track our time and our invoices. It’d be hard to run our business without it.</li>
<li><a href="http://cushionapp.com/">Cushion</a>. I started using Cushion when I was a freelancer, and it’s grown with my business. Thanks to it’s Harvest integration, I can fire it up at any time and see what projects I have outstanding, how heavily we’re booked, what invoices are outstanding, and how I’m tracking against our revenue goals. It’s invaluable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We’re a young business, and we’re constantly re-evaluating our processes and priorities. But a few things are clear:</p>

<ol>
<li>We’re having a ton of fun doing work we love, which is a gift unknown to many;</li>
<li>We’re succeeding as a remote business that offers extraordinary freedom, flexibility, and autonomy to its employees; and</li>
<li>We couldn’t have done it without Basecamp.</li>
</ol>
