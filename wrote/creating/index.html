<article class="block">
  <p><em>I am a generalist</em> — which is to say that I know a little bit about a lot of things. This has innumerable advantages, most notably that it allows me to add value to a diverse range of projects in lots of different ways. But while I’ve always found it easy to be a contributor, <em>I’ve found it incredibly difficult to be a creator.</em></p>

<p>Creators have cultivated within themselves that special skillset that allows them to see the world as it isn’t — yet — and make their imagination come to life. And I find myself incredibly jealous of them for it. But the truth is that the only difference between creators and non-creators is their mindset and their work ethic, and both of those things are within my power to change about myself.</p>

<p><em>To my mind, creating is simply the act of conceiving of something new and bringing it into existence.</em> That new thing does not need to be artistic. It could be a new piece of public policy, a commit on Github, a new perspective or a post on your blog. If you make something new that comes from your heart, you’re a creator. And creators change the world.</p>

<p>A friend recently shared the following quote with me, which has really taken root in my mind:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow and exclude people. So create. </p>

<p>—<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/15/why-a-tale-of-a-post-modern-genius/">Why the Lucky Stiff</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I want people to know me for the value I add to my community, not for what I’m interested in.</em> And I mean that in a broad way — not in terms of the typical concept of “community activism,” but from a perspective of whether the things I’ve created have added value to the people around me. If you stop and reflect for a moment, I suspect you’ll find that that is the common thread that unites all the people you admire the most: they’ve created something that enriches the lives of the people around them.</p>

<p>So… without making bold predictions, I’ll say that I’m going to work harder at being creative (in the literal sense). I’ll no longer let my self-doubt be the place where ideas go to die. When I have an idea, I’ll try it — or at least share it — even if doing so means that I’ll need to learn new skills necessary for bringing it into fruition.</p>

<p>At a most basic level, <em>that probably means more regular writing here.</em> Blogging, after all, is creating.</p>
