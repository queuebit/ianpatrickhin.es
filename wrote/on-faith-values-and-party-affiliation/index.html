        On Faith, Values and Party Affiliation

<article class="block">
  <p>I first registered as a member of the <a href="http://democrats.org">Democratic Party</a> at the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2003.</p>

<p>I was seventeen years old, and was on campus with my father to attend a rally for <a href="http://ianhin.es/8Qvo">Governor Howard Dean</a>. At the time, Gov. Dean&rsquo;s presidential campaign was beginning to surge and I got swept up in it; I soon found myself volunteering on the campaign full-time, and at that young and impressionable age I quickly internalized the campaign&rsquo;s rhetoric and made it my own.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, the Party became a central part of my life — it was the hub around which my professional and social life revolved. I was a Democrat&rsquo;s Democrat, a bitter partisan and an aggressive debater. I relished in challenging Republicans on the issues, and even more in winning.</p>

<p>A few years ago, however, something happened that began to change all that. A catalytic moment, I suppose. I became Catholic.</p>

<p>In coming to Catholicism from atheism, I made myself one promise: I wouldn&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafeteria_Catholicism">Cafeteria Catholic</a>.&rdquo; If I was to profess a faith that the Church is the custodian of Christ&rsquo;s teaching and is infallible — <a href="http://www.catholic.org/prayers/prayer.php?p=426">a profession I make each day</a> — then I must act accordingly: it could not merely be infallible when it taught things I believed previously or felt otherwise comfortable with. And further, my actions and intellect must be reformed to align with my beliefs. That meant changes.</p>

<p>So I started reading. I read opinion pieces, speeches, platforms and books from across the spectrum — from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>. And in doing so, I opened myself up to a world far wider than I had ever previously entertained. The more I read, the more I realized that the issues weren&rsquo;t nearly as black and white as the two parties try to portray them, and the more I found that my own views were — more often than not — center-right.</p>

<p>One author, in particular, resonated with me more than any others: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintin_Hogg,_Baron_Hailsham_of_St_Marylebone">Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone</a>.</p>

<p>A British nobleman who walked away from his hereditary title to pursue a seat in the House of Commons in 1938 and was known for the length of his career and the ferocity with which he campaigned for the British Conservative Party, had been tapped by Penguin Books in 1947 to write <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=the%20case%20for%20conservatism%20quintin%20hogg%20amazon&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThe-Case-Conservatism-Quintin-Hogg%2Fdp%2FB0022FNAVM&amp;ei=nklKUI-0FKbW0QHgkoDADg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFal2VbyEaVezqC3pSR9CpGQHA0PA">a &ldquo;succinct account of the principles which animate[d]&rdquo; his party</a>. Well, I read it; it was marvelous; and I&rsquo;d like to share two excerpts that really resonated with me:</p>

<p>First, on the necessary balance between secular government and the public practice of one&rsquo;s religion:</p>

<blockquote>For myself I say quite plainly that I can see no hope for secular society unless it be based upon a fundamental recognition of the spiritual nature of man and the providence of God, and in return I believe that religion owes to secular society the debt of recognizing that without the stability of the social order a full religious life becomes impossible except in the hermit&rsquo;s cell or in the monastery. I do not regard religion simply as a private fad, like having a hot-water bottle in bed,—a legitimate idiosyncrasy, but one which has no important consequences for a man&rsquo;s neighbours. I do not think that secular organization of the community in the state is self-sufficient, and I do not think that a wise secular government can hope for the permanence of its institutions by adopting an attitude of indifference to religious truth,—although it is driven, in a state like ours, to adopt an attitude of impartiality between a number of basically similar creeds.</blockquote>

<p>And second, on how one&rsquo;s political values must be tempered by one&rsquo;s religious beliefs:</p>

<blockquote>I believe in my country; I believe in the British Empire; I believe in liberty; I accept the secular authority of the state; profit and property and private enterprise are institutions I support; I desire to increase the material wealth and prosperity of my family and my country. Yet all these aspirations and beliefs are wrong, inconsistent and dangerous heresies unless they are governed and limited by the love and worship of God—at once the hub and the fellow of the wheel of life.</blockquote>

<p>These passages are — I think — insightful with regard to the relationship and interdependence of religion and secular government in the lives of citizens in a democratic society. And the first passage, in particular, foreshadows our present-day debate over religious liberty and the limits of government power.</p>

<p>There must be a balance between the secular and sectarian orders. Our society cannot function without a functioning, respected secular government. But our secular government, in its own right, should not be indifferent to The Natural Law, as the Democratic Party today seems intent on ensuring.</p>

<p>As The Vernerable Archbishop Fulton Sheen said, &ldquo;The truth is the truth even if no one believes it, and error is error even if everyone believes it&rdquo; — and government policy should reflect and respect the truth.</p>

<p>When I first got into politics, one of the things that I loved about the Democratic Party was that it developed policy based on observable facts. And I still do. I love that it&rsquo;s responsive to scientific research, and that it is constantly revising and improving policy based on a real-time analysis of whether that policy is working in practice. (See &lsquo;<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/open-government/report/2007/04/23/2911/the-citistat-model-how-data-driven-government-can-increase-efficiency-and-effectiveness/">the CitiStat model</a>.&rsquo;)</p>

<p>But over the last few years, it&rsquo;s become increasingly troubling to me that the Party seems incapable or uninterested in balancing the need for secular government with respect for eternal truths — even truths which are widely agreed upon by most faiths. Instead, it has increasingly adopted a staunchly secular attitude, which is perhaps best articulated by the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/314476/hhs-mandate-battle-l-martin-nussbaum">Obama Administration&rsquo;s regulation</a> regarding the coverage of birth control in legally mandated healthcare plans. And that&rsquo;s a posture that I can&rsquo;t reconcile with my faith or my values. And believe me — I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I attended the <a href="http://yda.org">Young Democrats of America&rsquo;s</a> &quot;<a href="http://www.ydafaithandvalues.org/">Faith and Values Summit</a>,&ldquo; which I understood to be a discussion of how our faith and values have inspired us to join the party. Instead, it turned out to be a discussion of how to communicate the Democratic Party&rsquo;s values to religious voters. As in: &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s how to win over fence-sitting Catholic voters by speaking in values-talk.&rsquo; That wasn&rsquo;t the entirety of the summit, but it was a significant component that left me with a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>Despite wrestling with these issues for many months, I held out in the hopes that this was part of the natural ebb and flow of the process and that things would right themselves in time. They have not. Instead, the party has doubled down: making access to contraception <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80599.html">a tent-pole issue at this years convention</a>, and implying that anyone who doesn&rsquo;t unequivocally favor universal access to abortion regardless of ability to pay — whatever their moral qualms — is a sexist and the someone to be overcome. And I&rsquo;m hugely disappointed that that&rsquo;s been the case.</p>

<p>I loved being in the Maryland Democratic Party. I love the friends — both personal and professional — that I&rsquo;ve made during my time in it. I loved the work that it&rsquo;s enabled me to do — from engaging and empowering Baltimore&rsquo;s diverse communities to moving Maryland&rsquo;s energy policy forward — and I hope to continue to be a part of that sort of work going forward. And most of all, I am thankful for the support that I&rsquo;ve been shown from friends and colleagues throughout the Maryland Democratic Party, in particular, who have given me many opportunities to serve my community, support my family and do work that I love.</p>

<p>But when I heard that the delegates to the Democratic National Convention voted three times not to include a reference to every individual&rsquo;s &quot;God-given potential&rdquo; in the Party Platform, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/09/05/jerusalem_and_god_get_booed_at_dem_convention.html">then booed when that language was adopted by the Chairman</a>, I could no longer turn a blind eye to the growing differences between me and the party that I had called home for nine years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that no one that I know agrees with everything that their party professes to stand for, whether they&rsquo;re Democrats or Republicans. But in my case my differences with my party — though they were only on a few issues — had become so pronounced and so prominent that I could no longer ignore them. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m now an Independent.</p>

<p>I thought it was a decision worth explaining.</p>
