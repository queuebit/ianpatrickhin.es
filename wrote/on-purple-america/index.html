        On “Purple America”
      </h1>

<article class="block">
  <p>In the wake of last week’s election, I’ve seen a lot of people — including my good friend <a href="http://512pixels.net/2012/11/red-and-blue/">Stephen Hackett</a> — pointing to so-called “<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Emejn/election/2012/">Purple America</a>” maps as evidence that the country is not nearly as divided politically as it might immediately seem. But I’m not sure that the people who’re sharing them fully understand what they mean.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with these maps, they break the country down into small geographic areas — usually counties — and use various shades of purple to illustrate the relative support for each of the two major parties in that area. The more blue the county, the more Democratic it is; the more red, the more Republican.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a new idea: such maps have been made to show election results in previous elections as well. And it’s an interesting way to look at the election, to be sure. But I think that most people misunderstand what these maps — which are essentially infographics — show and, perhaps more importantly, what they don’t show.</p>

<p>When contrasted with the more starkly red and blue Electoral College maps, these “purple” maps give the inaccurate impression that the country is far more moderate and far less partisan. But that’s not what they illustrate at all. In fact, these maps do not reflect the partisan or ideological loyalty of individual voters or of the nation at all, because they do not distinguish a reluctant partisan vote from an enthusiastic one in any way.</p>

<p>What they show is simply that, in most of the country, neighbors disagree on politics. Which most of us know intuitively already. These maps illustrate that the counties of America in which neighbors are in political agreement are far less common than those in which we disagree; they show that we’re very partisan and divided, not the opposite.</p>

<p>The more purple a given jurisdiction shows on one of these maps, the more divided its citizens were on matters of politics. Put another way, the purple areas are the battlegrounds — the places where the partisan war is most relevant. They don’t show that America isn’t Red vs. Blue, they show that it is — but that the battle lines are block by block, not state by state.</p>
