<article class="block">
  <p>After <a href="http://ianhin.es/2010/12/things-vs-the-cool-kids/">sharing Rob&rsquo;s post</a> about why you shouldn&rsquo;t switch to the new cool software just because all the &ldquo;cool kids&rdquo; are doing it, I noticed that he&rsquo;d <a href="http://simplellama.com/things/">posted</a> a more recent piece about why he wasn&rsquo;t interested in switching to OmniFocus himself. Chief among them was that the learning curve for OmniFocus was simply too steep to be worthwhile.</p>

<p>I disagree. Vehemently.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no arguing that OmniFocus has a steep learning curve. In fact, the Mac version is amongst the most complex and feature-rich applications I&rsquo;ve ever used. It is, at times, confusing. And, yes, it comes with a 60+ page <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/macosx/Manuals/OmniFocus-1.5-Manual.pdf">user manual</a>. But that&rsquo;s part of what makes OmniFocus so fantastic.</p>

<h2>Permit Me An Analogy</h2>

<p>An automobile&rsquo;s purpose it to get you from Point A to Point B faster than walking, and in many cases to bring cargo along, as well. Walking, of course, it simple&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been doing it for nearly your whole life. If you just wanted to get going with the least amount of friction, walking would be the way to go without a doubt.</p>

<p>Driving a car, however, is anything but simple. There are buttons, gauges, and -ometers galore. There&rsquo;s a wheel, and pedals, and mirrors. And then, to top it all off, there are all these <em>rules</em> you have to learn before you&rsquo;re even allowed to use it on the road. All this takes time, effort, and commitment. But the payoff is well worth it, because once you&rsquo;ve mastered the complex system of the automobile you&rsquo;ll be able to traverse vast distances far, far more quickly and efficiently than you ever could have on foot.</p>

<h2>My Analogy, Explained</h2>

<p>Most people start out managing their to-do lists as, well, to-do lists&mdash;just like most people start getting around primarily by walking. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s self-explanatory, and there&rsquo;s very little friction.</p>

<p>But many people will, eventually, find that their needs have changed and that the simplicity of to-do lists just aren&rsquo;t scaling to their current needs. For those people, there&rsquo;s the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280"> GTD framework</a>.</p>

<p>But, like driving, GTD (and, therefore, OmniFocus) has a steep learning curve. To implement it fully (and you really can&rsquo;t do it any other way) you&rsquo;ll need to change the way you approach your stress, learn a new system of organizing your thoughts and responsibilities, and likely re-work your entire work-flow. This, again, takes a lot of time, effort, and commitment. It&rsquo;s not at all frictionless&mdash;at least not in the beginning&mdash;but the long-term benefits are well worth the investment.</p>

<h2>We Don&rsquo;t Want Software For Dummies</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m just as big of a fan of software that does <em>one thing well</em> as anyone, but I think we&rsquo;re missing the mark if we start dismissing software as simply because it&rsquo;s complicated, or has a steep learning curve. That OmniFocus has <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/videos/">tutorial videos</a> and a long <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/software/macosx/Manuals/OmniFocus-1.5-Manual.pdf">user manual</a> do not make it a bad piece of software. Quite the contrary. OmniFocus was built to implement a complicated and thoughtful system, and so it is, by necessity, a complicated and thoughtful application.</p>

<p>Shawn Blanc used a great simile in <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2010/10/omnifocus/">his OmniFocus review</a>: OmniFocus is like a sledgehammer. It&rsquo;s not too big, or too small&mdash;neither too simple, nor too complex&mdash;it&rsquo;s perfectly suited to the task for which it was intended.</p>

<p>Like Cultured Code <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2010/12/state-of-sync-part-1.html">recently said</a>, sometimes &ldquo;to stop worrying about [something requires] worrying about it a lot at first.&rdquo; The folks at OmniGroup set out to make the best GTD software available, and they succeeded. But like an automobile, it requires some training to use properly.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
