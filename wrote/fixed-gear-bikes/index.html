        Fixed Gear Bikes

<article class="block">
  <p>Ever since I knew what they were I&rsquo;ve been a fan of fixed gear bikes. There&rsquo;s is just something about their simplicity that attracts me to them&mdash;the clean geometry, the simple maintenance, and the purity of their operation&mdash;in a way that&rsquo;s hard to describe. Fixies always feel like more than just a bike, which sounds a bit silly when written down.</p>

<p>There is something different about riding a fixie that is hard to describe. I think that&rsquo;s because you aren&rsquo;t really&nbsp;<em>riding</em>&nbsp;it in the way that you ride a free-wheel bike. On a fixie you almost absorb the bike as an extension of yourself; as you ride it you feel almost like there is no bike at all because you&rsquo;re just as involved in the process as if you were walking or jogging. It truly is one of those experiences that irrevocably changes your perspective, to the extent that I can&rsquo;t imagine riding a free-wheeled bike on a regular basis anymore.</p>

<p>I should note that I am in no way a part of the stereotypical &ldquo;hipster&rdquo; fixie community. I&rsquo;m actually more of a yuppie, for lack of a better&nbsp;<del>and less derogatory</del>term. I don&rsquo;t have a single friend who owns a fixie, and don&rsquo;t know how to do a single&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mashsf.com/videos.php">trick</a>. I just ride the bike to get me where I want to go. I just like these bikes.</p>

<p>I assembled my first fixie by hand, having collected all of the parts from various sources over several months. It was an incredibly gratifying experience. Every time I got on the bike I felt this incredible sense of ownership that&rsquo;s hard to describe (are you sensing a theme, here?)&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t the nicest bike around, but it was&nbsp;<em>my bike</em>. Unfortunately, it was stolen in a burglary in September of 2008 and I&rsquo;ve yet to replace it.</p>

<p><a class="fancy" title="My Bike (Stolen 09/2008)" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3082/3749217878_7cedba7bfc_o.jpg"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3082/3749217878_7cedba7bfc_o.jpg" alt="My Bike (Stolen 09/2008)" /></a></p>

<p>Happily, however, I think that&rsquo;s about to change. Starting as soon as this week I plan to start collecting the parts to rebuild it. I had previously considered building a&nbsp;<em>different</em>&nbsp;bike, i.e. taking the opportunity to move in a different direction&hellip; to try something new. But after doing a bit of shopping the last few days I think I&rsquo;m just going to replace what I had, albeit with a bit of an upgrade here and there. The two that jump out in my mind are a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brookssaddles.com/en/Shop_ProductPage.aspx?cat=saddles+-+touring+%26+trekking&amp;prod=B17+Standard">Brooks saddle</a>&nbsp;and some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/providencepista/3399561629/">Sugino 75s</a>. I&rsquo;m really pretty excited about it.</p>

<p>So, in closing, lets summarize: (1) I really like fixed gear bikes, (2) mine was stolen<em>out of my living room</em>, and (3) I&rsquo;m going to start building a carbon copy. I&rsquo;m quite excited.</p>
