<article class="block">
  <p>By most people&rsquo;s standards, I use a very old, and very weak, MacBook. Specifically, I use an early 2009 white MacBook&mdash;the old plastic ones no one remembers anymore. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;Pro,&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t perform like it. But at $999, it was all I could afford. And I was through with Windows.</p>

<p>Despite its hardware shortcomings, my MacBook has served me well in the 18-months I&rsquo;ve had it. It has been well equipped to handle everything I&rsquo;ve thrown at it&mdash;albeit not all at the same time&mdash;and now comprises the anchor in my suite of Mac devices (alongside my iPhone 3GS and iPad, both 16GB models). Together these devices make quite a formidable team, and it&rsquo;s a rare occasion when I find myself wanting more.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say that the addition of the iPad has made me realize my aging MacBook&rsquo;s biggest liability: speed. This is a slow machine. And frankly, that&rsquo;s a bit sad to say, considering it&rsquo;s only 18-months old. But it&rsquo;s true, all the same. Try to do too many things, and it grinds to a screeching halt&mdash;with nothing but the pinwheel of doom to console me.</p>

<p>I used to think that this was a result of insufficient RAM (it only has 2GB), but I&rsquo;m increasingly convinced that&rsquo;s only part of the problem. Again, <em>using my iPad has taught me that you can do incredible things with relatively weak hardware (processor and RAM) by having a Solid State Drive (SSD) as your startup disc.</em> And so, with the many Amazon Gift Cards I received this Christmas I bought myself an <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/mainstream/index.htm">Intel X25-M 80GB SSD</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but good things about SSDs, aside from complaints about the price. <a href="http://brooksreview.net/">Ben Brooks</a>, <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Patrick Rhone</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>,<a href="http://johnrust.net/"> John Rust</a>&mdash;they all swear by them. So I took their advice, and decided to make the switch. The SSD shipped yesterday, and should be waiting for me when I return from Texas on Sunday.</p>

<p>But when I tell people about my purchase, they&rsquo;re usually surprised. <em>&ldquo;Only 80GB,&rdquo;</em> they say. <em>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worried that&rsquo;s not enough?&rdquo;</em> Well, no. I&rsquo;m not.</p>

<p><em>My MacBook currently has a 120GB HDD, of which I am using a whopping 44.25GB.</em> Yes, you read that right, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">44.25GB</span>. That&rsquo;s all of my apps, documents, and system files. Plus the OS. 44.25GB, and holding relatively stable.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://cl.ly/3T2j0Q451304372g3P1m/Screen_shot_2010-12-27_at_10.40.54_PM.png" alt="Hard Drive" /></p>

<p>How is it that I&rsquo;m able to get by with so little internal storage? I avoid unnecessary clutter like the plague.</p>

<p>Having a 15-month old, my house is rarely, if ever, tidy for more than a few hours at a time. And that&rsquo;s as it should be. But for peace of mind, I need order&mdash;a place for everything, and everything in its place&mdash;and it&rsquo;s on my MacBook that I find it. <em>I keep my drives clean and orderly, my desktop empty, and my windows neatly sorted into 9 distinct Spaces. It&rsquo;s like digital feng shui.</em></p>

<p>Practically speaking, I suppose there&rsquo;s really four real tricks to keeping my internal storage needs low:</p>

<ol>
<li>No Photoshop: I am not a graphic designer by any means, so I don&rsquo;t have all the related digital collateral that comes with that field. Those files are large, and so for those of you who work with them regularly the need for a large drive is necessarily more urgent.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary applications: If I don&rsquo;t need it, I don&rsquo;t keep it. Or, better, I don&rsquo;t download it in the first place.</li>
<li>Save, at most, 1-2 versions of anything: For most things I am working on I end up with two files&mdash;a &ldquo;draft&rdquo; and a &ldquo;final.&rdquo; I tend not to save multiple drafts. It&rsquo;s just not necessary.</li>
<li>Keep media on an external hard drive: I have a 500GB Western Digital Passport drive that houses my iTunes and Aperture Libraries. You might say this is cheating&mdash;that it means I&rsquo;m not really using only 44GB&mdash;but these are simply files I don&rsquo;t need on an all-the-time basis that require massive storage space. Moving them off the internal drive was the best computing decision I&rsquo;ve ever made. I highly recommend it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I made each of these decisions for independent reasons rather than as part of some coherent strategy for shrinking my HD footprint. I genuinely didn&rsquo;t realize how little I was using until I started shopping for an SSD. I mention this because it goes to show you that you might be surprised to find out how little you actually need.</p>

<p>But, now that I&rsquo;ve started thinking about it, I think I can use even less. I&rsquo;m hoping that on my new SSD I&rsquo;ll use less than 40GB, and perhaps even approach 35GB. How? Three steps, the first two of which will be entirely painless.</p>

<ol>
<li>Exclusively use the free 2GB Dropbox account for file storage: I already keep all of my documents on a free Dropbox account, and I am only using 1.12GB. That 1.12GB includes every file I&rsquo;ve created or saved over the last 18 months, including all of my personal files from my last three jobs.<br /><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://cl.ly/2h0H1B3H2T3M0e2A1P0p/Screen_shot_2010-12-27_at_8.31.57_PM.png" alt="Dropbox" /></li>
<li>Only install 15 third-party applications:
<ul>
<li><a title="Get Dropbox (Referral Link)" href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMwMTYwODM5?src=global0">Dropbox</a>: For the reasons mentioned above.</li>
<li><a title="Get OmniFocus" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>: My GTD application of choice.</li>
<li><a title="Get Yojimbo" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a>: My everything bucket.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a>: Pages, Number, and especially Keynote are life-savers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a>: Its feature set is outdated, but it&rsquo;s home nonetheless.</li>
<li><a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder (beta)</a>: Even in beta, it&rsquo;s still the best feed reader I&rsquo;ve ever used.</li>
<li><a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>: For my HTML, CSS, and routine FTP needs.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>: For the heavier FTP lifting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>: For writing, publishing, and editing this site.</li>
<li><a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>: For getting to know my fellow webizens more personally.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/coversutra/">CoverSutra</a>: Quick, responsive control of iTunes. And Last.fm sync.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a>: Photo management. Preferred over Lightroom.</li>
<li><a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>: A handy desktop editor for my Simplenote account.</li>
<li><a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a>: For keeping my MacBook awake when I&rsquo;m otherwise engaged.</li>
<li><a title="Get Cloud App" href="http://getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a>: For sharing most anything.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t install what I don&rsquo;t need. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Extra language support in OS X: All I speak is English.</li>
<li>The entire <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a> suite: I&rsquo;ve never used any of it, except iPhoto, which has been replaced by Aperture.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/">Microsoft Office for Mac</a>: I&rsquo;m going to do my best to get by with just iWork. Even when dealing with documents from my corporate work environment or PC-centric graduate school.</li>
<li>No <a href="http://adobe.com/">Adobe</a> anything: No Flash, no Photoshop, no nothing. I never use any of it, anyway.</li>
<li>No extra browsers: Not <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>. Not <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>. Not <a href="http://rockmelt.com/">RockMelt</a> (Does anyone actually use that?). Safari is more than adequate.</li>
<li>No extra Twitter clients: I&rsquo;m keeping Tweetie because, as I said, it&rsquo;s home. But I certainly don&rsquo;t need a half-dozen others hogging up space for good measure.</li>
<li>No <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home">Skype</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, etc.: Running my MacBook in clamshell, as I normally do, leaves me without a video camera. No camera = no video chat. Deleted.</li>
<li>No trial versions: I&rsquo;m going to do my best to avoid the temptation to &ldquo;try&rdquo; new software based solely on the buzz. I&rsquo;ll need to be thoroughly convinced that I&rsquo;ll really use something, and be prepared to commit to doing so, before I&rsquo;ll download it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Of course, it must be said that there&rsquo;s no inherent value in doing things how I do them</em>. This is just what works for me. It suits my needs. <em>If I suddenly found tomorrow that I needed to use 60GB to get things done properly, I&rsquo;d do so</em>. You should do the same.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, I didn&rsquo;t get to this point out of some coordinated effort to use less. <em>Less is not more. Enough is enough. And for me, this is enough.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a quote from the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which I am shamelessly quoting from <a href="http://focusmanifesto.com/">The Focus Manifesto</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you&rsquo;ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, &ldquo;Is this necessary?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&rsquo;s not necessary, let it go. You&rsquo;ll be happier.</p>
