        Why I’ve decided to embrace Medium
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>Since Medium announced their most recent round of funding, feature improvements, and design changes, Twitter has been buzzing with two themes:</p>

<ol>
<li>More and more people using the platform; and</li>
<li>A small (but vocal) group of folks making clear that Medium’s nice, and all, but it’s just not for them.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a long time, I was with that second group. <em>“I want to own my content on my own domain,”</em> I argued. I didn’t like that Medium’s “reading list” recommended other articles that weren’t mine, or that readers may never make it back to my own website. And I didn’t see why I should help Medium build its business through my own hard work.</p>

<p>But over time, my feelings have changed. Now, I’ve become a strong fan of the platform. I’ve moved nearly all of my writing here, including opening up two custom-domained “<a href="https://medium.com/@ianpatrickhines/publications">Publications</a>.” I’m really enjoying it — so much so that I’ve become a bit of an evangelist. So what happened?</p>

<h2>Visiting Medium’s office in San Francisco</h2>

<p>Earlier this year I attended the <a href="http://lincolnlabs.com/">Lincoln Labs</a> conference in San Francisco, and while I was in town I had the chance to go to a lunch at Medium’s HQ. Why? Because <a href="https://medium.com/u/d07ce44c4aac">Matt Higginson</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/5402e692ba21">Jack Gerard</a> — from Medium’s team — reached out to me directly and invited me. It was the sort of exercise in community building that really wins me over. (I am an organizer, after all.)</p>

<p>Visiting their office and hearing Matt and Jack talk about the company’s vision really gave me a new perspective on the platform. They’re focused on building exactly the sort of community I want to be a part of: one focused on empowering people, elevating ideas, and including — even encouraging — diverse viewpoints.</p>

<p>I was also blown away by what I saw in the office. The staff was mostly gone for the weekend, and all around there were artifacts of their incredible attention to detail. A whole area dedicated to comparing and evaluating different typefaces, dashboards dedicated to encouraging feedback between teams, etc. It was exactly the sort of culture I’d want to encourage in my own business, and I’m keen to support that however I can.</p>

<h2>Opening up custom domains to publishers</h2>

<p>One of my primary concerns — initially — was that I didn’t want everything I wrote to live at a Medium.com URL. Call my old fashioned, but I like the idea of having my writing — particularly my business writing — live at a domain I can brand.</p>

<p>But in March, they started opening up <a href="https://medium.com/the-story/custom-domains-for-publications-8cb161d9651">custom domains for publishers</a>. That pretty much nipped that concern in the bud.</p>

<p>Now, I have two “publications” <em>(i.e., blogs)</em> that both live at custom domains: ideas.beag.co &amp; digitalfield.co. BEAG Ideas is dedicated to short, unpolished posts about or around my company, and Digital+Field is geared towards exploring the shared future of digital and field strategy in politics. Both are intended to have broad audiences and multiple authors, and my company’s marketing site didn’t feel like the right home for either of them. Medium is just the right environment for that writing.</p>

<h2>A shift in my own expectations</h2>

<p>It totally makes sense to me why someone who’s spent an enormous amount of energy building a brand around their writing — a professional blogger or podcaster, for example — would be reluctant to embrace Medium. There’s a real risk that any short-term gain that they realize would be undercut by a long-term devaluation of their brand. Even cross-posting the content could be a risk, so their natural inclination is to shy away from the platform as a whole.</p>

<p>I used to see myself as part of this group — using my writing to build up my brand and drive traffic to my site — but that feels less and less the case with each passing week. My brand, and my company’s brand, has become more and more about the work we do and less and less about my writing, and with that shift my comfort in writing elsewhere has increased.</p>

<p>My goal — now — is more to participate in the marketplace of ideas than it is to build an archive of my own. I’ve come to feel that the value of my writing is not the growth of my personal brand but how sharing my idea can help start or progress a conversation around the topics I care about. If doing so helps draw attention back to me and my business, that’s great; but if an individual article — like this one — gets read at all, that’s an end unto itself for me.</p>

<p>Conveniently, this change in my goals &amp; expectations has allowed me to take a lot of pressure off of myself as a writer. I no longer feel like I have to post on a particular schedule, or maintain a certain type or pace of content. Instead, I feel free to write often about whatever interests me in the moment — knowing full well that (unless I intentionally add the post to a publication) they all just flow into a series of independent posts. It’s been quite liberating. Giving up on “blogging” has made writing fun again.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don’t maintain my own, self-hosted microblog: I regularly share my thoughts on Twitter. And I have never felt that — by doing so — I was sacrificing my control over my own brand. Similarly, writing on Medium no longer feels like relinquishing my own writing to someone else. It’s a fantastic platform for articulating and sharing ideas, and not a half bad place to write.</p>

<p>Over the past month, I’ve found that — after email and Twitter — Medium has become the most used app on my phone and the most visited website in my desktop browser. Almost every time I visit, I find something interesting to read and a new idea I want to articulate in writing. Like I said: it’s made reading and writing on the internet fun again.</p>

<p>It’s definitely not for everyone but — as a former skeptic — I thought it was worth taking a minute to explain why it’s right for me.</p>
