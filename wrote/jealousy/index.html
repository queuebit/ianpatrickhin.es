<article class="block">
  <p>Conventional wisdom has always been that men have it so easy during pregnancy. Of course, that&rsquo;s true: women do all the physical suffering, and, of course, have to go through labor! But there are certainly elements of being an expectant father that I am finding to be frustrating (much to my surprise). The one that stands out the most has been the jealousy that I&rsquo;ve been feeling towards the relationship that Christy already has to the baby.</p>

<p>I know, this sounds kind of cooky, but I seriously have found myself feeling envious of her at times, particularly when she tells me she feels the baby kick. See, right now she can apparently feel the baby kicking / moving internally. I think that&rsquo;s great, and I&rsquo;m really excited every time she tells me (I mean, how cool is that!?). But the frustrating thing about it is that it&rsquo;s not the kind of &ldquo;feeling the baby kick&rdquo; that you imagine when you hear the phrase: she can only feel it internally, which means I don&rsquo;t get to share that experience one bit.</p>

<p>In my mind I know that eventually I&rsquo;ll be able to feel the kicks on the outside, and that (of course) I&rsquo;ll get more than enough of the baby&rsquo;s personality over the next several decades, but right now I can&rsquo;t help but feel like I&rsquo;m left out of some important bonding experience that Christy is having. The experiences that a father has during pregnancy are very much 2nd-person, and sometimes I think that&rsquo;s a bit sad.</p>

<p>Again, I know that it&rsquo;s not all a bed of roses for her (quite the opposite). I don&rsquo;t have to deal with morning sickness, cramps, aches, pains, fleeting cravings and an inconsistent appetite. But I would take those things if I could, even just for a moment, experience some of the fun parts of being pregnant.</p>

<p>Or maybe this is all me, a guy, living in my dream world and not understanding how god-awful frustrating being pregnant really is. Maybe ignorance is bliss. Maybe, but I don&rsquo;t know. And I&rsquo;d like to.</p>
