        My baby is going to be the best thing since pockets.

<article class="block">
  <p>My whole life I&rsquo;ve always heard about how a parent&rsquo;s love for their child is unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever known. You know the stories: &ldquo;No matter what I&rsquo;m always proud of you,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;When I had my children nothing else seemed as important anymore.&rdquo; I always had a little trouble understanding that until recently when, just as had always been predicted, I started to get it when I had my own kids (or in my case, will have).</p>

<p>The first few weeks after I find out I was having a baby were spent just trying to get my mind around the concept. It&rsquo;s a pretty radical change, and even though I was thrilled it still took a lot of getting used to. The first moment I heard about it was filled with the most indescribable combination of excitement, fear, pride, and worry I&rsquo;ve ever had. But once it started to grow, and Christy started showing, I started (it&rsquo;s still happening) to feel like the father everyone always told me I would.</p>

<p>It really is exactly like you&rsquo;ve heard: that once you&rsquo;ve got a child nothing else seems as important. But what&rsquo;s more surprising is that that feeling is almost a relief. It actually feels pretty good, after years of college &amp; career planning, to just focus on what&rsquo;s best for my family&mdash;to have a singular focus around which to plan everything else.</p>

<p>Christy has always been very supportive of me doing whatever I wanted in terms of my career, and as a result I&rsquo;ve always been very intent on making sure I do work that I enjoy. But over the last few weeks it&rsquo;s become increasingly clear to me that the line of work I had been focusing on me would, by its very nature, take me aware from my family and make me (in my view) a poor father. That is unacceptable to me, and though I&rsquo;m not sure what changes I&rsquo;ll make I know that the plan as previously constituted no longer suits the circumstances.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s not a problem, because my kid&rsquo;s going to be the best thing since pockets, and that&rsquo;s just on Day One. I want to be home for dinner, read bedtime stories, and take walks in the park. I want to be there for sports practice, parent-teacher conferences, and weekend day trips. Most of all I want a job I can count on, so that I always know when I need to be at work and when I&rsquo;ll be at home; I want to do everything I can do be sure that I don&rsquo;t ever have to worry about where my next paycheck is going to come from, or whether I can afford a doctor&rsquo;s visit.</p>

<p>Nothing else seems as important as those things anymore, because someone&rsquo;s going to call me Dad. And &ldquo;Dad&rdquo; means &ldquo;Make-sure-everything-works-out-okay Guy&rdquo;.</p>
