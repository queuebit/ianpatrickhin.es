      <h1>
        Ring, Ring. Hello?
      </h1>
    </header>

    
<article class="block">
  <p>Recently my son, who&rsquo;s fifteen months old today, has discovered electronics.</p>

<p>He loves to watch those Baby Einstein movies, which I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say I occasionally use as a babysitter when I really need to get stuff done. He recognizes my iPhone from across the room, although he isn&rsquo;t really sure what to do with it when he gets it. And he is content to sit indefinitely with me while we watch YouTube clips on the iPad. (<a title="This is a song about Elmo" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py2f38iPBeI">This one</a> and <a title="Elmo's Song" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSYadh2xmcI">this one</a> are his favorites.)</p>

<p>But most recently he&rsquo;s discovered the telephone.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no way I was going to let him experiment with my iPhone. He&rsquo;s a big fan of throwing things over precipices (stairs, tabletops, etc.), and you never know what will be next. Instead I dug up an old flip phone I&rsquo;d been keeping in a junk drawer since 2007, since it really doesn&rsquo;t matter whether he breaks it.</p>

<p>At first he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. He knew it was neat, but wasn&rsquo;t sure why. Then he figured out it was a phone. You know, that you can listen to.</p>

<p>Now when I say, <em>&ldquo;Oliver, where&rsquo;s your phone?,&rdquo;</em> he runs and finds it. If I say <em>&ldquo;Ring, Ring. Hello? Is Oliver there?&rdquo;</em> he holds it up to his head. Never his ear, though, which is peculiar. He&rsquo;ll get it.</p>

<p>The other day I was at the top of our stairs (on the second floor) folding laundry when I saw him standing at the bottom. I said <em>&ldquo;Hello!,&rdquo;</em> and he immediately held his phone-less hand to his ear. Adorable is an understatement.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to watch him learn these sorts of things, because he spends just about the same amount of time hearing people through Skype as he does through the phone. With my parents living in Texas now we do a lot of video conferencing, and he genuinely responds to them as if they were right there in front of him.</p>

<p>What a world he&rsquo;ll grow up in. Makes me feel old.</p>
