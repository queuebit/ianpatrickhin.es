<article class="block">
  <p>With my recent upgrade from an iPod Touch to an iPhone&nbsp;<span class="caps">3GS</span>, I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time fiddling with my settings and app positions. Though it may seem silly to some people, having my apps in just the right configuration is really important to me: it gives my iPhone a personal feel, and dramatically increases its usability.</p>

<p>A big source of inspiration for me as I&rsquo;ve approached this task has been&nbsp;<a href="http://firstand20.com/">First and 20</a>, &ldquo;a collection of Home screens of some of the best and brightest developers, designers and tech writers.&rdquo; I find that seeing how other people are utilizing their iPhones has opened my eyes to new possibilities, and as a result has really improved my overall experience.</p>

<p>Then, today,&nbsp;<a href="http://patdryburgh.com/">Pat Dryburgh</a>&nbsp;took it upon himself to share his own First and 20; after reading his post, I decided to do the same.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0J3q3u313G01381G2C2o/4131949869_831100113d.jpg" alt="First and 15" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not as creatively oriented as many of the folks I see on First and 20; for me, my iPhone is more about communication, reference, and time management than it is about creative expression. I think that focus shows through in my choice of apps.</p>

<p>As with&nbsp;<a href="http://patdryburgh.com/post/256026626/my-iphone-home-screen">Pat</a>, I chose to only use three rows of apps after seeing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.firstand20.com/homescreens/shawn-blanc/">Shawn Blanc&rsquo;s</a>Home Screen on First and 20. It&rsquo;s just so much more usable with less clutter.</p>

<p>I keep&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;on the Home Screen so that I can easily toggle Location Services, Notifications, and WiFi. I truly love having access to all of these features, but the power cost usually outweighs the benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Messages</strong>&nbsp;is sequestered to the top row because I try to avoid using it (I only have 200 messages allowed on my plan). Keeping it in the dock, where it feels most natural, simply made it too tempting to use regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Safari</strong>&nbsp;is, like Messages, on the top row because, while having quick access is important, the frequency with which I use it is simply not that great. In practice I do most of my web browsing in&nbsp;<strong>Instapaper</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Tweetie&rsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;in-app browser.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Camera</strong>&nbsp;is positioned exactly where the actual camera is found. That just seemed right.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t spend as much time using&nbsp;<strong>Facebook</strong>&nbsp;as I used to, but it&rsquo;s still an absolutely indispensable tool for communicating with the people I know. I use Facebook as a global rolodex, literally connecting with everyone I know. With over 740 &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s become the most comprehensive&nbsp;<span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;up-to-date contact management application I have.</p>

<p><strong>Fever</strong>&nbsp;<span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;<strong>Instapaper</strong>&nbsp;are used to keep track of all non-news items I&rsquo;d like to read. By non-news I mean not printed by a mainstream media outlet (i.e., blogs and the like). Newspapers, et al., get their own page of apps (the third page).</p>

<p><strong>Tumblr</strong>&rsquo;s iPhone app was one of the primary reasons I decided to migrate to Tumblr from my self-hosted ExpressionEngine blog. It&rsquo;s so clean, simple, and easy to use that I sometimes find myself searching for content to post just so I have a reason to be in it.</p>

<p>The bottom row is made up of apps I use to plan&nbsp;<span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;chart my day.&nbsp;<strong>Weather</strong>&nbsp;usually only receives one or two looks per day, but it&rsquo;s generally the first thing I open in the morning. There are lots of more comprehensive apps for checking the weather, but none of them match Weather&rsquo;s simplicity.</p>

<p><strong>Calendar</strong>&nbsp;helps me keep from double-booking myself or being late. My only pet peeve with Calendar is that it should display a &ldquo;Week&rdquo; view when held in landscape mode. This just seems like common sense to me.</p>

<p><strong>Things</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;application for&nbsp;<span class="caps">GTD</span>. It&rsquo;s got a great&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span>, it&rsquo;s easy to use, and it syncs via WiFi with the desktop version. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d get by without it.</p>

<p><strong>DAYTUM</strong>&nbsp;is the only web-app on the Home Screen. It&rsquo;s also the only app that doesn&rsquo;t really serve a practical purpose: it&rsquo;s really more of a toy or novelty than anything else. The only reason it warrants a spot in the top-15 is that if it weren&rsquo;t so readily accessible, I wouldn&rsquo;t keep up with it.</p>

<p>The apps in my dock are the ones I go to most often. There are only three because they are, truly, the only three apps that I&rsquo;m in and out of constantly. (As I mentioned before, Facebook and Messages would be close candidates for fourth.)</p>

<p><strong>Phone</strong>&nbsp;needs no explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Mail</strong>&nbsp;is synced with my Google Apps account at&nbsp;<a href="http://ianhines.com/">ianhines.com</a>&nbsp;via Exchange, with Push enabled.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, comes&nbsp;<strong>Tweetie</strong>&hellip; my most used app. There&rsquo;s really not much to say except that of all the Twitter clients I&rsquo;ve tried, Tweetie feels the most natural (to the extent that I prefer to use Twitter on the iPhone than on the Mac).</p>
