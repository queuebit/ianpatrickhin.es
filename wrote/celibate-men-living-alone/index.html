<article class="block">
  <p>I found this nugget tucked inside an article about the <a href="http://www.thepassionists.org/">Passionist fathers and brothers of the Province of St. Paul of the Cross</a>, a &ldquo;shrinking, financially challenged Roman Catholic community&rdquo; that has taken the rather unorthodox step of putting up $50,000 to help fund a Broadway production. That story itself is interesting, but I&rsquo;m far more intrigued by this quote &mdash; and particularly in how it reflects the challenges facing Catholic communities across the country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the early 1960s, the province had about 630 members; young men drawn to the Passionist brand of religious life routinely replenished its ranks. Today, it has about 144 members. The average age is 78. And very rarely, as in nearly never, does anyone knock on the door to ask about becoming a novice. &ldquo;I have dear friends with kids who have gone to college, and they can&rsquo;t dream of letting their boys and girls go into religious life,&rdquo; the Rev. Columkille Regan, 90, said. &ldquo;Nothing makes less sense to them than celibate men living alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pass&eacute;,&rdquo; he added, speaking for Passionists and, perhaps, for other Catholic religious orders as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s pass&eacute;. Nor do most of the Catholics I know. But I&rsquo;m a married man, and a Catholic convert, to boot. When I was younger &mdash; before I was married &mdash; I was not Catholic. And if I was, I doubt I would have been interested in becoming a priest.</p>

<p>When I attend the <a href="http://lifeteen.com/">Life Teen</a> mass at Our Lady of the Fields &mdash; the parish where I was married &mdash; it&rsquo;s clear that there are no shortage of passionate, faithful, <em>Catholic</em> young men. So why do so few of them find their way into the priesthood?</p>

<p>These young men aren&rsquo;t skeptics; they&rsquo;re the types of guys who are on a first name basis with their own parish priest, and who &mdash; at 17 years old &mdash; give up their weekends to practice with the church choir. That the Church can&rsquo;t convince these young men that the priesthood might be right for them &mdash; I think &mdash; speaks to a larger cultural challenge affecting our society at large, and one that Father Regan speaks to in the passage above.</p>
