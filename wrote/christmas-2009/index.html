<article class="block">
  <p>Christmas is an incredibly complex holiday. It is simultaneously about faith&nbsp;&amp; family. Its multiple personalities do not always blend well, and they rarely make scheduling easy. I&rsquo;d like to share a little bit about my holiday with you, from the lens of each way that I celebrated it.</p>

<h2>Mass</h2>

<p>The first, and most important, aspect of Christmas is Christ&mdash;the Man who made it all happen. We celebrated Mass at our regular parish&mdash;The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary&mdash;on Christmas Eve at an abnormally early 4:00pm. The Basilica was in excellent form, with Christmas trees&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;poinsettias arranged &lsquo;just so,&rsquo;&nbsp;<del>almost</del>&nbsp;everyone in their Sunday Best, and the choir pulling out all of the stops. Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Edwin O&rsquo;Brien, and the Gospel was my favorite Christmas reading: Luke 2.</p>

<p>Before we went to Mass it really didn&rsquo;t feel like Christmas, but afterwards I felt fully charged and ready to embrace the spirit of the season. I suppose that&rsquo;s as it should be, but it really made an impression on me how much the Mass affected my overall mood and holiday spirit. I think that hearing the choir, the Liturgy of the Word, and praying with the rest of the congregation really brought home the notion that&nbsp;<strong>Christmas is here</strong>.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<p>There really is nothing like spending the holidays with your family: it really reinforces the importance of tradition. After Mass we drove down to my parents house in Millersville,&nbsp;MD, which is approximately 30-minutes from the Basilica in light traffic. We were greeted there by my parents, sister, brother-in-law, aunt, uncle, and cousins. Bing Crosby brought the holiday cheer, my mother made a fantastic dinner, and for a time I forgot all of the cares of my everyday life.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve at my parents has been a tradition as long as I can remember (before it was my parents&rsquo; house it was my grandparents, but still the same tradition in the same home). It&rsquo;s pretty crazy to think about how memorable Christmas Eve really is: I can&rsquo;t rememeber any other day of the year&mdash;not even Christmas&mdash;with the same level of detail over the same number of years.</p>

<p>Christmas Day, as our family tradition would have it, was spent with Christy&rsquo;s family. In the morning, starting around 9:00am, we open presents with her parents and siblings at my mother-in-law&rsquo;s house in Crownsville. Just like visiting my parents on Christmas Eve, Christmas Morning at my in-laws has become such an integral part of my Christmas tradition I can&rsquo;t imagine doing it any other way. We eat a late breakfast (late for us since we&rsquo;ve already been up a few hours), open gifts, then all travel to Christy&rsquo;s Grandmother&rsquo;s house to vsit with the extended family for the day. I love it, at least in part, because it allows me experience that thing I was always missing: the&nbsp;<strong>big</strong>&nbsp;family.</p>

<h2>A Word About Oliver</h2>

<p>This is, of course, Oliver&rsquo;s first Christmas and all of the things one would expect to experience have come his way. Everyone wanted a photo with the little-guy, he got more presents than he could ever use, and all-the-while he had no idea anything notable was even happening.</p>

<p>For me, my first Christmas as a dad was a real treat that I&rsquo;ll remember my whole life (even if he didn&rsquo;t think anything of it).</p>
