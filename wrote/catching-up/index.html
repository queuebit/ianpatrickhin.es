<article class="block">
  <p>I’ve had a busy few months. Let me catch you up.</p>

<h2>Quitting My Job</h2>

<p>A few months ago I left my job with the Maryland Department of Human Resources without knowing what I would do next. It was — possibly — the riskiest thing that I have ever done as an adult: impulsive, rash and incredibly liberating.</p>

<p>Why did I quit? As with anything, the reasons are complicated and many, but suffice it to say that it just wasn’t a good fit for me anymore.</p>

<p>I’m good at working in government — which is why I’ve done it for the past four years, and why I got a Master of Public Administration degree — but I don’t love it. In my experience, working in government often feels like treading water: you’re constantly working, but you’re really only addressing the symptoms of the problem (i.e., keeping yourself afloat) rather than progressing towards a solution (i.e., swimming to shore). And that can be incredibly frustrating.</p>

<p>I have realized that I want my work to be truly meaningful, and not just on a personal level; I want to work on things that are going leave a massive mark on the world — things that are disruptive.</p>

<p>Which is what brought me to <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/?recruiter_id=219736">NationBuilder</a>.</p>

<h2>Joining NationBuilder</h2>

<p>One of the most compelling things about the internet is its potential to empower, connect and amplify groups and individuals working towards a common goal. But to do that, you need a killer website and a powerful people database — and until recently, there were only two ways to get those things: (1) hack together disperate tools into a buggy, Frankenstein’s Monster-type toolkit or (2) invest massive sums of money into developing a bespoke system. In practice, this has meant that only two sorts of people were able to leverage the Internet’s potential: geeks and the super-wealthy / connected.</p>

<p>NationBuilder’s mission — in a nutshell — is to disrupt that model by offering an insanely powerful, integrated and affordable toolkit specifically designed to organize people around a common cause. We believe at a core level that everyone has the potential to be a leader and are making the best toolkit for community organizing in human history available to everyone.</p>

<p>For my part, I’m a Political Organizer — which means that I’m specifically charged with reaching out to and building relationships in the political community. I’m working with people across the political spectrum — trying to understand their goals, objectives and passions — and help explore whether NationBuilder can help to achieve them. And the best part is that, by genuinely helping them to be successful, I am helping NationBuilder to be successful as well. It’s an incredible business model, and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.</p>

<h2>Moving to Los Angeles</h2>

<p>The one hard part about this transition for me has been relocating to Los Angeles. Anyone who knows me will know that I am a passionate and enthusiastic Marylander, so moving three-thousand miles from home has been a major adjustment. They don’t know how to make a proper crab cake here; they sing the National Anthem wrong; etc.</p>

<p>I flew to California the night before Election Day all on my lonesome — leaving the wife and kids — and will be here well into December before I’m able to move them out here. It’s probably worth saying that I genuinely don’t know how I’d have done this without FaceTime; thank you, Apple, for letting me see my children every day.</p>

<p>I’ve been here just over a week, now, and everyone has been fantastic. This city — and it’s weather — are nothing short of amazing, and I’m sure I’ll feel right at home just as soon as my family gets here. Who knows, I might even buy a <a href="http://dodgers.com/">Dodgers</a> hat.</p>

<h2>Rebooting The Blog</h2>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfooding">dogfooding</a>, I have migrated my blog entirely from WordPress to NationBuilder.</p>

<p>With this move, which (nearly) coincides with the new year, I’m going to try mapping out a content strategy for blog posts over the next few months. I’ve never really done this before, but I’m increasingly of the mind that I need to be more intentional about sharing what I know in a meaningful way, rather than just droning on about some random topic from time to time.</p>

<p>So if you have anything particular topics you’d like me to discuss, please let me know on the suggestions page. I’m going to try and compile a decent list in the coming days and use it to map out content for next year.</p>
