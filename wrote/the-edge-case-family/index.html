      <h1>
        The Edge-Case Family
      </h1>

<article class="block">
  <p>When I was expecting my first child, at 23-years old, I was (comparatively) very young and among the first of my friends to have children. I could tell that people were shocked at the news — “What? Kids?! That’s great!&ldquo; — but they seemed genuinely excited for me. As well they should have been.</p>

<p>When my second child was announced, things were a bit different. We were expecting a girl, and due to arrive a month after my sister’s daughter — to boot. Everyone was excited (&quot;Two girls?! Besties!!!&rdquo;), and things were a bit easier for us the second go-around. We already had nearly all of the “stuff” we needed — the crib, the car seat, the high-chair, etc. — and, having already been through labor, delivery and the first few months with our first child, knew what to expect.</p>

<p>But things are different with our third.</p>

<p>I’m excited for him to arrive, but I am not at all apprehensive. I know I’ll love him, and I know he’ll be the most amazing, adorable, aggregating, maddening child I’ve ever seen — since his sister, anyway. My excitement is, however, tempered by the knowledge that — when he arrives — we’ll quickly become an “edge-case” family.</p>

<p>It’s hard to perceive until you experience it yourself, but trust me when I say that the modern world has been built for a “family of four.” We seem to have arrived at a place where it’s expected that every member of a middle-class family will have an iOS device, but shocking that any middle-class family might have more than two children.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? Here is a short list of routine things that will be much more difficult (and often more expensive) with three children:</p>

<ul>
<li>going to a restaurant, because we now don’t fit nicely at most tables and booths;</li>
<li>riding rides at theme parks, etc., because they’re built for two people per row;</li>
<li>renting an apartment, because three bedroom units are both uncommon and unaffordable;</li>
<li>buying a car, because we (basically) have to buy a mini-van, which narrows our options an reduces our leverage in negotiations;</li>
<li>working, because childcare is genuinely unaffordable for three children — even in a two-income family;
etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not the ongoing expense of having three children (food, clothing, etc.) that is burdensome. Rather, it’s the cost of being the edge-case family — the family of five — that no longer fits the neat customer models of the big businesses that control restaurants, car manufacturing, housing, etc., that makes the transition from two children to three so difficult. It’s as if there’s an economic penalty built into the market to discourage having three children.</p>

<p>What’s exasperating is that other people seem to notice the penalty, as well — and they treat you (politely) as if you deserve it. In conversation, you start to find a lot of people say things along the lines of: “Well, sure… but you’re the one who decided to have three kids.” or “Three kids?! Yikes! Good luck, man.” or “Wow. That’s a lot of kids.”</p>

<p>Yes… it’s my fault. I should have had fewer children so that I would have fit neatly into the pre-defined market segments mapped out by big businesses. How selfish of me to go off-plan.</p>
