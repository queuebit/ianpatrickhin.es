<article class="block">
  <p>You may have noticed that the pace of my writing has slowed. Let me tell you why.</p>

<p>On February 17th I was diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a>. Specifically the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Signs_and_symptoms">inattentive-type</a>, which is to say my struggle is with focusing rather than with hyperactivity. This marked the culmination of years of prodding by family and friends who, rightly, recognized that I was struggling with distractibility, procrastination, organization, and prioritization.</p>

<p>For most of my life I got by, with much success, by simply &ldquo;winging it&rdquo;: I didn&rsquo;t study; I rarely did homework that wasn&rsquo;t graded; and I frequently pulled late nights in order to complete projects on time (because I waited until the last minute). I was constantly behind on nearly everything&mdash;often because I had entirely forgotten that it needed to be done.</p>

<p>Of course, you never forget the top thing on your mind, and for me that was the website. I love writing for this site, and would regularly find that I&rsquo;d be doing so at the direct expense of other, more important things&mdash;like spending time with my wife and son. This misplaced focus slowly&mdash;but steadily&mdash;began to levy a real toll on my relationships and happiness.</p>

<p>Something had to give.</p>

<p>Then, on February 7th, something clicked. I was driving back from a press conference and listening to &ldquo;<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/3">Back to Work</a>&rdquo; with <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a> and <a href="http://hivelogic.com/">Dan Benjamin</a> when Merlin began to tell the story of how he, as an adult, was diagnosed with and began treatment for ADHD. Merlin Mann&mdash;Mr. Productivity&mdash;had attention deficit disorder. My harsh, inaccurate stereotypes were instantly shattered.</p>

<p>If Merlin&mdash;someone I really look up to in terms of personal achievement, self-management, and quality of work&mdash;was struggling with this problem then maybe, just maybe, I might be too. So I asked my doctor about it at my next physical exam, which was only 10 days later.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I had every symptom on the list. In fact, my doctor speculated that my over-the-top caffeine habit (5&ndash;8 mugs of coffee/tea per day) was a form of self-treatment&mdash;that I had been using the caffeine to help restore balance and focus. I began formalized treatment just prior to departing for Ireland in March, and began to see a real difference once I returned to my routine about 10-days later.</p>

<p>The month that followed has been one of the best of my adult life. I feel like I am in command of my day&mdash;of myself&mdash;in a way that&rsquo;s difficult to describe. For the first time in memory I have the confidence of knowing that I&rsquo;m <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">focused on the right things at the right time</a>. I&rsquo;m paradoxically working harder than I ever have before, yet not at all overwhelmed or exhausted by it. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with my lack of writing on the site? (Don&rsquo;t worry, I haven&rsquo;t lost focus!) The reason I have slowed on the writing is because, well, it&rsquo;s not my top priority right now. It is a priority, but not the top one. Nor the second. In fact, it&rsquo;s fourth.</p>

<p>I have lots of tasks (more than 1,300 currently in OmniFocus) for which I am responsible, but only a few real priorities. They are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Love and serve the Lord in accordance with the teaching of the Church;</li>
<li>Be an exceptional father to my son and husband to my wife;</li>
<li>Excel at my work in order to earn a living (see priority #2) and serve my fellow citizens; and</li>
<li>Pursue my personal passions and interests.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Those are my priorities. At any given moment I may have 30 tasks that need completing, 12 of which are past due, and only 30 minutes in which to work. How do I decide what to do next? I work down the list in order of priority: God; Family; Work; and Personal.</p>

<p>In practice, that means that the personal goals and projects come last, and therefore are often deferred. It&rsquo;s irresponsible of me to devote time and energy to writing for this website when I haven&rsquo;t said my prayers, cleaned the house, played with my son, or dealt with work.</p>

<p>I love writing, and I am humbled and honored that each and every one of you has chosen to give me your invaluable time and attention. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t imagine myself giving this site up: it means far too much to me.</p>

<p>My hope is that a slower pace will mean that what I do post&mdash;both link posts and original pieces&mdash;will be a bit more thoughtfully curated and written. There are lots of articles and the like that seem perfect for a link post in the moment, but decidedly less so with a day or so&rsquo;s distance. Expect to see less of that.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that I&rsquo;ve been writing less because I&rsquo;ve been getting more of the important things done. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll flesh the whats and hows of that out a bit over the coming weeks. In the meantime, thanks again for your time and attention&mdash;and for your patience as I work to regain control of mine.</p>
