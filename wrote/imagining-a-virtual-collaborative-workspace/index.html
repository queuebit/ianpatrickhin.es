<article class="block">
  <p>A few months ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/ghostlymeg">Meg Lewis</a> at <a href="http://ghostlyferns.com/">Ghostly Ferns</a> shared the story of how she’s built a <a href="http://ghostlyferns.com/extras/2013/12/10/the-no-employee-design-team">no-employee design studio</a>: a network of designers and developers who collaborate on an ad hoc basis under the guise of a studio. As a new freelancer, I absolutely love the idea of working independently, together, and I’ve been chewing on it since.</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say that my favorite thing about working at <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/?recruiter_id=219736">NationBuilder</a> was the community we developed for ourselves within the office. I loved my coworkers — hell, I still do — and the atmosphere that our open office created. At any point, you could pop over to someone’s desk, ask them a question, and get really honest feedback. In fact, feedback is a hugely important part of the culture at NationBuilder, because it’s by providing — and receiving — honest feedback that we grow. As a freelancer, I’ve really missed that.</p>

<p>I’ve tried a few different things to recreate that dynamic as a freelancer, but it’s hard when you’re primarily working alone. I believe that the fundamental elements that make working collaboratively in an open office so special are a casual atmosphere, honest feedback, and serendipity. Twitter, Dribbble, etc. can give you the first and the last, but it’s not a good medium for giving or receiving honest feedback — which requires openness and understanding. Am I willing to share my early-draft versions of my work on publicly for the whole world to see? Not generally. And is 140 characters really the right size for helpful, constructive feedback? Often not.</p>

<p>I think that what’s needed is a virtual place where friends can work independently, together: the digital, remote analog of <a href="http://studiomates.com/">Studiomates</a>. A place where you can share your raw work-in-progress without a filter, shoot the shit about whatever’s on your mind, and collaborate on an ad hoc basis. I suspect that a private, digital community like that help push us to do better, more creative work and relieve some of the lonliness that comes with working from home, without the membership cost and commute of a more traditional coworking space. At least I hope so.</p>

<p>And, as it happens, a tool has just recently come along that could facilitate this very thing: <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. Without getting into too much detail about what they do, Slack has the capacity to bring each person’s work-in-progress together in a searchable, discoverable network that also enables real-time chat and collaboration. It’s the digital realization of the open office / collaborative workspace that I’ve come to know and love.</p>

<p>Anyway, the bottom line is this: I’m keen to try it. If it sounds interesting to you, and you’d like to be a part of it, drop me a line in the comments or <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=ianpatrickhines&amp;text=%40ianpatrickhines%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20working%20independently%20together.%20Lets%20talk.">say hello on Twitter</a>. It could be fun.</p>
