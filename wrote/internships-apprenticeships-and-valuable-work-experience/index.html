<article class="block">
  <p>Today on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/@missliconde">Djenab Conde</a> wrote a pretty <a href="https://medium.com/race-class/75b0577f904d">dead-on</a> piece about why our modern internship market is so broken. </p>

<p>To wit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unpaid internships are not the exception; it appears they are quickly becoming the rule. And this rule is throwing the playing field off-kilter, heavily in favor of the wealthier candidates.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The problem I have outlined is not exclusive to undergrads trying to hustle during their summers; graduate students and even graduates are still participating in unpaid internships.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>There is more and more evidence of internships replacing former entry-level jobs in the guise of equal benefits: the intern gets experience and the employer reduces costs. We are told that if we tough it out at our internship, we may get a job offer. Well, that is not necessarily true…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all definitely accurate to my experiences with internships, both as an intern and as an employer.</p>

<p>As an intern, I rarely did meaningful work that would have prepared me to be a qualified employee. Instead, I did a lot of grunt work: the sort of work that is expected of an entry-level, poorly qualified employee. My employers were — by and large — unapologetically using me to offset the cost of hiring an entry-level employee.</p>

<p>But lest you think I am free of guilt in perpetuating this broken system, I&rsquo;ll confess that I have acted similarly as an employer. I regularly thought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got so much rote work to do. I wish I could get an intern.&rdquo; I wanted an intern to do entry-level work for me. Intern == Assistant.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not at all what an internship should be. Internships should be like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship">apprenticeships</a>, which Wikipedia defines as &ldquo;a system of training a new generation of practitioners of a structured competency a basic set of skills.&rdquo; Internships are generally thought of as a means to gain &ldquo;experience.&rdquo; Apprenticeships are generally thought of as a way to learn and hone &ldquo;skills.&rdquo; Which would you rather have: experiences or skills? If you want to be a successful professional, I hope you said skills.</p>

<p>Most of the big sectors of the economy — government, big business, nonprofit, marketing, etc. — are stuck in the &ldquo;internship&rdquo; mindset, and they&rsquo;re unlikely to shake themselves out of it anytime soon. But luckily there are small businesses, especially those in the digital economy, who get the value of apprenticeships both to their business and to the market as a whole. </p>

<p>One such business is <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/">Sparkbox</a>, a smart web development shop out of Dayton, Ohio. Sparkbox takes investing in people seriously, offering both <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/internships">internships</a> and <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/apprenticeships">apprenticeships</a>. About their apprenticeships, they say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the first months of your apprenticeship, you&rsquo;ll be exposed to the core technologies of our work and work flow. Everyone, regardless of job title, will be brought to an understanding of Sparkbox&rsquo;s convictions on the priority of content, value of design, semantic HTML, and mobile-first CSS. You&rsquo;ll be exposed to our Github-centric project management, our deployment processes, best practices for clean code and separation of concerns, and unit testing techniques.</p>

<p>By the end of your apprenticeship, you&rsquo;ll be interacting as a full-fledged team member. Your confidence will be up, you&rsquo;ll have some work under your belt, and that&rsquo;s when the real fun begins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s what a valuable internship / apprenticeship should be all about: learning a trade. You should begin knowing little and end by knowing much. And in an economy in which <a href="http://am.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/08/turning-white-collars-blue/">so many employers complain about a lack of skilled workers to fill open positions</a> — in both white and blue collar professions — this should be a no brainer.</p>
