<article class="block">
  <p>When I first came to <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/?recruiter_id=219736">NationBuilder</a> last Autumn, I didn’t really know what to expect. I’d never been to California before, and I’d never worked at a startup, either. In fact, the only jobs I’d ever held were in government — which is about as different from a startup as you can possibly imagine. I certainly didn’t imagine that I’d meet so many amazing people, help so many incredibly organizations, or become an expert at leveraging the most advanced community organizing toolkit the world has ever seen. So, of course, that’s exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve done nearly every job there is at NationBuilder. I’ve worked on the organizing team, doing direct customer support and sales. I served on the frontline team, where I was responsible for diagnosing and triaging bugs and theme issues. And for the past two months, I was responsible for email delivery — working directly with customers and their NationBuilder Organizers to ensure their email blasts were delivered to their supporters’ inboxes. At one point or another I’ve worked on every one of NationBuilder&rsquo;s features; I know it like the back of my hand.</p>

<p>But startup life is very hard on families, and as a father of three I was starting to find it difficult to burn the candle at both ends. I was commuting 2.5 hours a day — leaving the house before sunrise and getting home just in time for dinner. And I was working fewer hours than most of my colleagues (bless their hearts). After a year, it was pretty clear that to be the best father to my children I would need to make a change. And so I have.</p>

<p>I’ve never worked anywhere as amazing as NationBuilder, and I may never be so lucky again. If you’re not familiar with it, <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/mission">the company’s vision</a> is to unlock the potential of a connected humanity by making everyone a leader. It’s powerful stuff, and in pursuit of it they’ve built a team of <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/jobs">incredible people</a> and <a href="http://nationbuilder.com/features">a product</a> that&rsquo;s unparalleled in the world today. I’m going to miss it, but I take comfort in the fact that — through my freelance work — I’ll continue to work closely with my friends on the organizing team to help their customers be successful.</p>

<h3>So what am I doing?</h3>

<p>I’ve dreamed for a long time about freelancing full-time. Now, I’m <a href="http://the.beag.co">doing it</a> — and it feels <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

<p>That said, I’m not trying to start some fancy company or studio. I’ve been building relationships online since 2007, and when people think of me, they know that I’m a politico and NationBuilder expert. That’s the brand I want to be known by. I want to <a href="http://www.ianpatrickhines.com/wrote/being-yourself-online">be myself online</a>. </p>

<h3>Accepting work</h3>

<p>Starting today, I’m open for business. I’ve put up a <a href="http://the.beag.co">list of services</a> that — based on my experience at NationBuilder — I think would be helpful to folks, but it’s not an exclusive list. I have <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/ianpatrickhines">wide and varied experience</a> in political communications and digital organizing, and I’d like to put it to good use in the service of others. If you or anyone you know would like to discuss how I might be able to help your organization achieve its goals, please don’t hesitate to <a href="http://the.beag.co">say hello</a>.</p>
